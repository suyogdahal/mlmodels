                          Request For Discussion
                                for the
                          OPEN  TELEMATIC GROUP

                                  OTG

I have proposed the forming of a consortium/task force for the
promotion of NAPLPS/JPEG, FIF to openly discuss ways, method,
procedures,algorythms, applications, implementation, extensions of
NAPLPS/JPEG standards.  These standards should facilitate the creation
of REAL_TIME Online applications that make use of Voice, Video,
Telecommuting, HiRes graphics, Conferencing, Distant Learning, Online
order entry, Fax,in addition these dicussion would assist all to
better understand how SGML, CALS, ODA, MIME, OODBMS, JPEG, MPEG,
FRACTALS, SQL, CDrom, cdromXA, Kodak PhotoCD, TCL, V.FAST, and
EIA/TIA562, can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
TELEMATIC/Multimedia applications.

We want to be able to support DOS, UNIX, MAC, WINDOWS, NT, OS/2
platforms.  It is our hope that individuals, developers, corporations,
Universities, R & D labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.

This would be a NOT_FOR_PROFIT group with bylaws and charter. Already
many corporations have decided to support OTG (Open TELEMATIC Group) so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

An RFD has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a FAQ will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject.  If
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below.

This group would publish an electronic quarterly NAPLPS/JPEG
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version.  We urge all who wants to
see CMCs HiRes based applications & the NAPLPS/JPEG G R O W, decide to
join and mutually benefit from this NOT-FOR_PROFIT endeavor.

NOTE: Telematic has been defined by Mr. James Martin as the marriage
      of Voice, Video, Hi-res Graphics, Fax, IVR, Music over telephone
      lines/LAN.

": While I'm sure Sagan considers it sacrilegious, that wouldn't be

Hardly.  The Keck telescope in Hawaii has taken its first pictures; they're

I believe that this orbiting space junk will be FAR brighter still;
more like the full moon.  The moon upsets deep-sky observation all
over the sky (and not just looking at it) because of scattered light.

"Picture our universe floating like a log
in a river.  As the log floats down the
river, it occasionally strikes rocks, the
bank, the bottom, other logs.  When this collission
occurs, kinetic energy is translated into heat, the
log degrades, gets scraped up, and other energy 
translaions occur.  The distribution of damage to
the log depends on the shape of the log.

However, to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a
termite in the center of the log, the shock waves from the
collissions would appear uniformly random in direction.

This is my theory for GRB.  They are evidence of our universe
interacting with other universes!  Why not!  Makes
just as much sense as the GRB coming from the Oort cloud!

The log theory of universes can't be ruled out!

"I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,
   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.
   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,
   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,
   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.

   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. 
   -----------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)

NAME
   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations

DESCRIPTION
  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both
  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.

  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the
  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using
  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The
  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed
  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.

  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and
  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss
  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of
  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).

  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image
  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-
  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
  giving great flexibility in processing an image.

FEATURES

  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, 
  the processed image will be displayed.

  Current features include

  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing
    and filling the ""rotated out"" region with an arbitrary color.

  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with
    the option of subpixel sampling.

  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an
    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to
    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text
    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
    in TeX(1), e.g., $\alpha$\small$\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha
    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.

  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.

  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation
    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels
    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished
    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-
    lability of graphical histograms of the image.

  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-
    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at
    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering
    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,
    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions
    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a
    circle).

  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-
    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.

  o Performs histogram equalization.

  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of
    arbitrary order.

  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.

  o Cuts and pastes across images.

  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.

  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
    interval between images. (SlideShow)

  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities
    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.

  o Performs image type conversions.

  o Converts image formats.

  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).

  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
    back and display it.

  o Modify an individual pixel's RGB values.

  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
    resulting power spectra.

  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).

 SUPPORTED FORMATS
      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS
      o  JPEG(JFIF) format
      o  CompuServ GIF
      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.
      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)
      o  TIFF
      o  PostScript(Write only)

Hardware requirements:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.

Where to get it:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z
   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73

   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking

Acknowledgement:
---------------------------------------------------------------
   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups's library Version 4.
   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.
   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.

---------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate
  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of
  your editing needs. In addition, the external filter and dynamical
  kernel will utilize any program you already have. So try it
  (and you will like it).",1

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

        references in BibTeX format, available to the computer graphics
        community as a research and educational resource.

        The database is located at ""siggraph.org"".  Users may download 
        the BibTeX files via FTP and peruse them offline, or telnet to
        ""siggraph.org"" and log in as ""biblio"" and interactively search
        the database for entries of interest, by keyword.
        For the people without Internet access, there's also an e-mail
        server. Send mail to

        archive-server@siggraph.org

        and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
        followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is
        with the command
             send index
        which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.

        Additions/corrections/suggestions may be directed to the admin,
        ""bibadmin@siggraph.org"".

	of images.  Uses its own format (MIFF), and includes some converters.
xv - X-based image display, manipulation, and format converter.
xloadimage, xli - displays various formats on an X11 screen.
Khoros - a huge, excellent system for image processing, with a visual
	programming interface and much much more.  Uses X windows.
FBM - another set of image manipulation tools, somewhat old now.
Img - image manipulation, displays on X11 screen, a bit old now.
xflick - Plays .FLI animation under X11
XAnim - plays any resolution FLI along with GIF's(including GIF89a animation
	extensions), DL's and Amiga IFF animations(3,5,J,l) and IFF
	pictures(including HAM,EHB and color cycling)

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.


+RED

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan

  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

Indeed so; it's at the extreme limit of what is humanly possible.  It is
possible only because Mount Everest is at a fairly low latitude:  there
is a slight equatorial bulge in the atmosphere -- beyond what is induced
by the Earth's rotation -- thanks to the overall circulation pattern of
the atmosphere (air cools at poles and descends, flowing back to equator
where it is warmed and rises), and this helps just enough to make Everest-
without-oxygen feasible.  Only just feasible, mind you:  the guys who did
it reported hallucinations and other indications of oxygen starvation,

"This discussion on ""objective"" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the
recent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually
observe phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is
""subjective"" and that even atom are ""subjective."" This is getting a bit silly
and the word ""objective"" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the
definition of ""objective"" which has been already presented:

  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as 
    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.
    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on
    observable phenomenon.

The Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that
thing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there
exist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable
phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental
processes, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable
phenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. 
Even weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though
that observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon
affected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not
change to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not
objective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the
point of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively ""good;"" I
will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. 

Now some examples things which are ""objective"":  A D-12 tractor is larger
than the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.
There exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks 
ultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.

""Good"" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn't seem to have an
existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the
existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined ""good"").  We cannot
quantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag
full of ""good"").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word ""good"" an
objective meaning, e.g.  ""good"" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,
speed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see
""strength"" and etc, as necessarily ""good"" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism 
is not generally viewed as ""good""). 

As to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based
on verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of
the ""Golden Rule,"" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss
people off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a
manner you won't like.  This is verifiable; when you ""get in someone's face,""
they will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a
more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can
at times, ignore that form of the ""Golden Rule"" without fear of reprisal.  Now
as to whether this enforcing of morality is ""good"" or ""bad,"" is quite
subjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing
cannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that
that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical
existence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such
thing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a
morality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such
morality. 

One other thing to notice, ""objective"" is many times used as synonymous with
""true"" and/or ""absolute,"" and ""subjective"" sometimes has the connotation of
""false"" and/or ""relative."" Tain't necessarily so.  For instance, when a
conclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be
both objective and false.  As to ""absolute,"" it is easy to note that while we
can objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean
that all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute
either.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either
""absolutist,"" or ""true."" For instance, there are some theists who are
specifically ""absolutist"" in their morality, even though they have only
subjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective
has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a ""gut feeling"" or ""hunch""), to
investigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence
necessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to
agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective
evidence.

No.  It follows from the fact that most Christians' choice of
interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by
the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully
determined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some ""right""
interpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to
read the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was
Michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural
influence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but
regardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point
of contention between Michael and myself. 

I have argued -- beyond Michael's claims -- that the Christian
scriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a
wide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their
most important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that
there is some ""right"" interpretation *unless* there is a way to
determine what that ""right"" interpretation is.  It is the lack of
an objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that
puts the force behind the line I argue.


There are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently
broad range of color, that I can find a few that support my
example. 



In my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully
acknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to
determine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity
hold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion
within this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that
much of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by
ideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have
called conservative must also interpret, but they do not
recognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and
importance of this.


I recognize that Michael is part of the tradition.  But what does
it tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry
Fallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon?
Not very much!



I think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian
principles that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in
the Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian
scripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his
political stances.  That one should love one's neighbor is a 
purely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance 
for homosexuality is *not*.

As to these political stances, they are often at odds with what
is commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I 
suspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other
hand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these 
political stances become most influential when presented to 
those who need them most.)

"In an attempt to do animation with POV I have created two little
programs. One is a C program that will perform a ""morph"" between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. And then
it will write the points, and the function (translate, rotate, etc.) out
to a file. Then I have a Perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. I had hoped this would
let me do simple animation. However, I have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. Now I know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but I know there 
must be another way around this. I had thought perhaps it was because
I had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation, which could cause this behavior. However
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. Any help is 
appreciated.",1
"isaackuo@skippy.berkeley.edu (Isaac Kuo) states in reply to deleted
article about no-knock searches, arrests



In general no-knock raids are to preserve evidence, like drugs,
which can be flushed down the toilet.  They are not the standard way
to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber.  If there is no need to
search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and
order the suspect to come out with her hands up.  If the suspect does
not come out tear gas will be used.


comment on the BD omitted



It is not a method to apprehend criminals.


It is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be
destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way.  It is the most
dangerous way to arrest anyone.  The cops are charging into a room
and they don't know what is in it.  It is much safer to surround the
place and announce yourself.



Cops are not cops _until_ they identify themselves as police officers.


Most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the
likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works.  If they
are arrested they call their lawyer, post bail and hope for a plea
bargain.  If they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will
be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid.  Drug
dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other
criminals, not to shoot cops.  Cops are shot on no-knock drug raids
because the criminals aren't aware that they are cops.

No-knock raids on homes occupied by non-criminals are more likely to
end in disaster.  Mom and Pop citizen _KNOW_ that they have not
committed any crime, they KNOW that anyone breaking into their house
cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong.  If they have
the means to defend themselves they may because they KNOW that the
housebreakers are criminals not cops.  Cops and homeowners may die.

The first reports from Waco stated that the ATF had a warrant to
search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal
weapons were found.  In this case the no-knock warrant was not called
for.  It is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet.  The ATF could
have surrounded the compound.  A marked police car could have driven
up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and
served the warrant usual way.  It this had happened and and Koresh
refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of
the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.

#That's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.

It's not a fallacy - note the IF.   IF a supermajority of disinterested people 
agree on a fundamantal value (we're not doing ethics YET Benedikt), then what 
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
observation?

#For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike
#a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are
#many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy
#does not hold.

I have, however, given an example of a VALUE people agree on, and explained
why.  People will agree that their freedom is valuable.  I have also
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
ethics - the IF assertion above.  And that is what I'm talking about, there
isn't a point in talking about ethics if this can't be agreed.

#One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,
#while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
#with a set of morals YOU have to give.

I'm not doing morals (ethics) if we can't get past values.  As I say,
the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
aren't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable.
Maybe not, and I want to think about this some, especially the implications
of its being true.

#Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing
#your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

Garbage.  That's not proof either.

#The above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer

Hmm...are you a Taoist?  Imposing limits *does* do something useful...it gives
you something to go beyond.


I tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of Taoism.  I especially
tend to frown on any suggestion that ""orthodoxy"" or ""classics"" have any
special place in Tao.


So rather than debate what ""Taoism *REALLY* means"" you are suggesting that
we take someone else's word for it and work thusly?  I'd rather not, thank
you.


Whereas you, of course, have a clear idea of what the word means?  Can
you tell the Tao? :-)


Wonderful idea.

PEXLIB and PHIGS (as it comes from MIT with PEX and as is explained in the
PHIGS Programming Manual) are just different API's for the PEX protocol,
which is an extension to the X protocol.

So it depends on You, what you go to use.

Advantage of Phigs is the protability to other platforms (IBM GraPhigs, 
SunPhigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3D objects.

Advantage of PEXlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for
immediate mode graphics, because PEX is not an exactly mapping of Phigs
to a Prortocol.

Well 48 bit colour *could* be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive. I have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision. More than that would seem to be wasted.

Perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range - RGB is a cube so it is a compact encoding.

Most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
frame buffers. This set up, called double buffering, allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
frame) is displayed. This makes for smoother animation.


Well hey if you want to brag about numbers, the 5000 range can take a PXG Turbo+
card with 96 bits per pixel. Full double buffering (Two 24 bit buffers), a 24
bit Z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

Mind you the card costs more than your workstation.

I think you're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing
policy, too.  You make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets
and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door.  As I
understand it, that is not the case; we aimed deliberately at civilian
targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the
German people.

This is one of those ""yes, but"" things. It's true that a hydraulically
pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube,
but even at 2000 PSI levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily,
though it's straight-on compressive strength is high, and it's torsional

there's no doubt that hydraulic ""leverage"" exists in nature. Tree roots 
are an example. Given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure

Kangaroos 3-limbed? I don't think so. If you take the view that the
tail is a limb, then monkeys and kangaroos are 5-limbed. I think the
tail is a different kind of structure, grossly enlarged in the case
of the kangaroo, but primarily still an instrument of balance rather
than locomotion. I don't know much about panda ""thumbs"", so I'll ask
is it opposable?


Well I won't say flat out that they can't be intelligent, but I'll
bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why I
don't think it's likely. First let me say that when I say ""intelligent""
I mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level
with, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming
suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter 
it's enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That's certainly not
a universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice
for a putative technological alien.

Now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but
it's generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level
of complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron
cells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur
wouldn't have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument
is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There's room
for a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One
reason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages 
that trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult
for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very
large creatures. So there's little selection pressure for such brains.
Instead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn't rule out
intelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.

Then there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the
lemur needs to eat frequently because it's internal heat is rapidly
lost due to it's high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature
that must spend most of it's time and energy feeding won't have the time
to develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.
The dinosaur's problem is the reverse, it must moderate it's heat production 
because it's high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. 
I'm assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical
reactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would
tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that
of humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded
creatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that
some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature
the size of a brontosaur, it's activity levels would have to be restrained
or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the
waste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the
ocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence
to manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the
environment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur
would be capable of that much activity.

"John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:

 * ""The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *
 *  treated as a matter of faith."" -- Francis Hitching                     *

  I have a few points to make about the above posting.

    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of ""quotes"" from either
    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)
    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive
    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike
    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests
    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they
    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a
    creationist and this may not be your real intent.

    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his
    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.
    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate
    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may
    not be your real intent.

    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of ""the modern theory of
    evolution"" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one
    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond
    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.

    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack
    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on
    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the
    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long
    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and
    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a
    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.


Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:

 * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *

  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchings
is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the
part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (""The Neck of
the Giraffe"").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could
not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution
(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a ""non sequitur"" (i.e.
the conclusion ""does not follow""). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard
Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]

  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber
in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was
titled ""`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far"".  Excerpts include :

  ""Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.""  ""He goes after Darwin like Mark
  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and
  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.""  ""He suggests
  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs
  in different creatures as evidence [sic].""

  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not
against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't
surprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.
he only posted a quote).

"Another article that fell between the cracks:

 As evidence for the Resurrection, it is often claimed that the Disciples

 Now, I skimmed Acts and such, and I found a reference to this happening
to Stephen, but no others. Where does this apparently very widely held
belief come from? Is there any evidence outside the Bible? Is there any
evidence *in* the Bible? I sure haven't found any...

Briefly, no.  There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary
evidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.
Further, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is ""No
Martyrs for a Lie"": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather
than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the
quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered
the chance of life by recanting.  Since we don't even know how or
where they died, we certainly don't have this information.  (By the
way, even in the case of Stephen it is not at all clear that he could
have saved himself by recanting).  The willingness of true believers
to die for their belief, be it in Jesus or Jim Jones, is
well-documented, so martyrdom in and of itself says little.  [See
1Kings18:20-40 for a Biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests
of Baal].

to those who offer me baseless insults.  For example, those who accuse me 
of lying about my personal beliefs, while also complaining that I don't answer
their questions.  

#>#Like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there.
#>#If only everything would be so easy.
#>
#>What almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there.
#>Because to all intents and purposes, it *is* there.
#> #We had that argument. For one, your claim that everyone senses it
#is not founded, and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.
#And then, the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it
#is there unless evidence against it has been found.

I have no problem with the second statement.  I have provided an
argument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered
by some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about
fuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It's a good point, and I'm thinking
about it.
# 
#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,
#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that
#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,
#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject
#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological
#claim, you have to prove it.

Nonsense.  My ""trick"" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so 
does almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore 
that A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and
that the resulting system of values is self-consistent.

Now get this:  ""really is better"" is an idealisation, a fictional model,
in the same sense that ""real material existence"" is a fictional model. It
may or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful
_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist 
""trick"", to wit:

I feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person
I ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,
or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,
then it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing
more can be said.  

I say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority
seeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to
maximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that 
a supermajority's carefully considered morality would be better than the 
terrorist's - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical
relativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is
simply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival
anything in the world of religion.

#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not
#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by
#>#others.
#>
#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively
#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this
#>is possible.  It is neither evidence for subjectivism, nor evidence
#>against objectivism (except sometimes, in a pragmatic sense).
#>
#It serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to
#judgements is absolute. And as long as you don't provide evidence for
#that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to
#believe your hypothesis.

I've done this: freedom, with the proviso that I still have to 
answer jon's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no
objective meaning.

#Further, in order to make morality absolute, universal, or objective,
#you would have to show that it is independent of humans, or the attributes
#above look quite misleading.

Not really.  What evidence is there that _anything_ exists independently
of humans?  You'll be hard pressed to find any that isn't logically
equivalent when applied to values.

#>An analogous set of premises would be:
#>
#>Premise 1:  Some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest
#>            route  from my house to a bar is through the main entrance
#>            of the estate, and down the Malahide road.
#>
#>Premise 2:  I checked it out, and found that the shortest route from my
#>            which is much closer.
#>
#>You would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my
#>house to a bar; yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim,
#>using premises which are logically no different.
#>
# 
#No. Morals are a matter of belief so far. The people still believe that the
#shortest way is through the main entrance. No agreement on *belief* here.
#And in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a
#shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it
#is the shortest way indeed. In other words,  your analogy works only when
#one assumes that your  premises are right in the first place. If not, it is
#a fallacy.

And if this were an argument for objectivism, you'd be right.  It isn't,
though, it's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument
*against* objectivism, nor argument *for* relativism.  Your gimmick is to
assume in the first place that values aren't real, and to use this to ""prove""
that values aren't real.  In other words, you beg the question against me.

        To the North Pole!

        On June 2 and 7, 1983, two of the Soviet Union's mighty PROTON 
    rockets lifted off from the Tyuratam Space Center in the Kazakhstan 
    Republic.  Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe 
    for the planet Venus. 

        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing
    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the
    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic
    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core
    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of
    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by
    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels
    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large
    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The
    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger 
    to properly transmit this information to Earth. 

        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed
    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)
    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a
    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by 
    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus'
    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). 

        The Soviet probes' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over
    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects 
    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the
    VENERAs' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations 
    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the 
    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern
    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or 
    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially 
    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.

        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 
    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, 
    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a 
    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around 
    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA 
    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus' 
    first polar-circling spacecraft.

        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 
    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north
    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers 
    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  
    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over 
    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back 
    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took 
    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions 
    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers 
    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.

        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more
    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, 
    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, 
    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the 
    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean 
    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the 
    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids 
    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) 
    across, due to Venus' very dense atmosphere.

        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists
    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes' 
    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the 
    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest 
    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American 
    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell 
    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern ""continent"" of Ishtar Terra.  

        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about
    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later
    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar
    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-
    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be 
    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan 
    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even 
    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet 
    probes maintained that distinction.

        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted
    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the 
    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world's
    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about
    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few
    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating 
    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds 
    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) 
    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty 
    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees 
    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.

        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were 
    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at 
    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to 
    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control
    gas to perform the operation.  

        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving 
    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six 
    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an 
    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.

        Venus by Balloon

        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting 
    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet's mantle of 
    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of 
    the French space agency Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)
    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint 
    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, 
    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.

        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, 
    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full 
    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe 
    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.

        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named
    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei
    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft 
    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one 
    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  

        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to 
    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.
    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from
    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists 
    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such 
    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  

        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar 
    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall 
    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice 
    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar 
    encounter.

        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and
    Japan's Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not
    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a
    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical
    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the 
    comet, while Japan's first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and 
    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. 

        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet
    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel
    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget
    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to
    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of 
    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter 
    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor 
    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.

        The Soviets' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building
    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify
    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an 
    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,
    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of 
    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the 
    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. 
    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the 
    location of the comet's erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive 
    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.

        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA
    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander
    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the
    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers
    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released
    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)
    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had
    successfully arrived. 

        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was
    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a
    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen
    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as
    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat
    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment
    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,
    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for
    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special
    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which
    permeated the planet's atmosphere. 

        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just
    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag 
    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened 
    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  
    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as 
    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  
    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar 
    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists 
    had thought the planet's surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight 
    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.

        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day
    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600
    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did
    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer
    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers
    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three
    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the
    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers
    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and
    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the
    journey.  The layer's air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius
    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.
    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. 

        Early in the first balloon's flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already
    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with
    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 
    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the
    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the
    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen
    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to 
    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 
    miles) above the surface. 

        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before
    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not
    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of
    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never 
    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature 
    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees 
    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander's 
    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background 
    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.

        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and 
    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data
    returned during the lander's plunge through the atmosphere.  The
    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, 
    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active 
    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.
    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air
    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)
    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.

        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks 
    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.
    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2's results
    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers 
    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were 
    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 
    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a
    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), 
    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-
    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air 
    over the last seven years.

        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last 
    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on
    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around
    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March
    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the 
    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.
    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial
    bodies with one space vessel.

        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for
    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2
    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking
    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning
    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)
    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still
    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.
    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent 
    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-
    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the ""continent"" of Aphrodite 
    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 
    miles) towards the surface.

        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air 
    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius 
    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1
    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed 
    through the balloon's level.  No positive indications of lightning
    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat's nephelometer 
    failed to function.

        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite
    Terra's western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900
    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander's resting place was smoother
    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a
    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in
    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, 
    rare on Earth but present in Luna's highlands.  This rock is rich in 
    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree 
    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured 
    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,
    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.

        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at
    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin 
    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 
    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet 
    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers 
    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three 
    hours.

        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley
    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the 
    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-
    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance 
    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets 
    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly 
    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was 
    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  
    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.

        Future Plans Diverted

        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous 
    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second 
    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for
    the early 1990s.

        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple 
    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft 
    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon 
    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet's 
    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over 
    the VEGA balloons' two days.  The mission would then head out to 
    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible 
    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main 
    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.

        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in
    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA
    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet
    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space 
    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction 
    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this 
    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next 
    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on
    Mars' largest moon, Phobos. 

        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,
    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and 
    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.
    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious
    consideration of human colonization in the near future.

        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars
    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,
    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other
    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon
    landing in March of 1989. 

        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to
    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the
    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put 
    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have
    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of
    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. 

        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change
    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began 
    to ""open up"" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with 
    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the 
    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking 
    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a ""free market"".

        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.
    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making
    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring
    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to 
    make money.  

        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for 
    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price 
    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary 
    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United 
    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.

        MAGELLAN and GALILEO 

        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration
    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.
    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of
    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most 
    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When
    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be
    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108
    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.

        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space 
    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit 
    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle 
    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, 
    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the 
    probe's primary target's major moons in 1610.

        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on
    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around
    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach
    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO's first planetary
    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the
    planet's swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in
    that violent atmosphere.

        On the Drawing Boards

        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,
    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-
    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet 
    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, 
    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions 
    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also
    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.

        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects 
    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes
    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected
    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing
    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air
    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed
    to study Venus' atmosphere while descending through the thick air
    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.
    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.

        Humans on Venus      

        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?
    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure
    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something
    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into
    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like
    Earth's.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking
    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide 
    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability 
    to speed up the planet's rotation rate to something a bit faster
    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries
    if not millennia.

        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand
    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how
    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became
    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?
    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found
    through international cooperation, including the nation which 
    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.

activities beginning at shortly before 5:00 AM yesterday, C9 commanded
the spacecraft to execute a series of slews and rolls to provide the MAG
(Magnetometer) Team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and
orientations for the purpose of better characterizing the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.

The spacecraft was commanded back to Sun Star Init state at 9:07 AM to
re-establish Inertial Reference.  Transition back to Array Normal Spin
began at 11:17 AM, after which the sequence powered on the on-board
transmitter at 11:18 AM.  Telemetry reacquisition occurred at
approximately 11:30 AM at the 4 KBS Science and Engineering downlink
data rate on the High Gain Antenna.  Subsystem engineers report that all
systems appear to be nominal.  The command to terminate using the Low
Gain Antenna for uplink was sent at 12:31 PM.  Uplink and Downlink are
currently via the HGA.

MAG Calibration data has been recorded on Digital Tape Recorders 2 and 3.
Playback of DTR 2 is scheduled to take place tomorrow morning between
8:11 AM and 12:42 PM.  Playback of DTR 3 is scheduled to take place
tomorrow evening beginning at 11:57 PM and ending at 4:28 AM on Friday.
DTR playback will be performed via the High Gain Antenna at 42,667 bits

I'll be blunt about this. The ONLY reasonable explanation of Roberts

Go to the library and look at this.

There is also a somewhat muddled explanation in the first edition

  Speaking of proofs of God, the funniest one I have ever seen was in a
  term paper handed in by a freshman.  She wrote, ""God must exist, because

  doesn't!""  Is this argument really so much worse than the ontological
  proofs of the existence of God provided by Anselm and Descartes, among
  others?",0

   _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
   no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
   to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
   ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
   by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
   least it was a good try...

So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?
Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
models.

A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this
paper, send a message to astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the subject
line 
  get 9304001


Here is the abstract of that paper.

   The currently favored explanation for the origin of \GRBs puts them
   at cosmological distances;
   but as long as there is no distance
   indicator to these events all possible sources which are
   isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
   why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
   although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
   from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
   originate in the solar cometary cloud
   cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

   We use the available data on the distribution of \GRBs (the BATSE
   catalogue up to March, 1992), and
   the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits  by Marsden and Williams (1992) to
   investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations
   between the angular distributions of \GRBs and comets' aphelia,
   assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect,
   at least to some extent, true variations
   in the column density of the Oort cloud. We also apply the $\vov$
   test to both distributions.",2
"
Looking at your discussion I would say that you both operate
from your own reference frame. There's no inside and no outside,
there are just two polarized views. As for statements inside the
Bible, things are still not that clear, we don't have any indications
for instance why Jobs was placed in the Old Testament, one of the 
few books that actually talks about Satan. Jobs is very much out
of line with the rest of the OT books, and there's a chance that
someone added this book later into the group of OT scriptures.


This operates the other way around as well. You have to understand
the mind of an atheist, agnostic, or as in my case, a radical
relativist. If you don't understand the underlying concepts, it is 
pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. I'm not a perfect Christian,
however about 20+ years of Christian teaching should have provided
me with a pretty good picture of the Christian mind frame.

Cheers,
Kent

Actually, both numbers are correct.  The difference is in the direction
of the acceleration.  For pilots, accelerations tend to be transverse to
the direction you're facing (pulling out from a steep dive, the
acceleration will force blood toward your feet, for instance).  In this
case, you can only put up with about 8 g's even with a pressure suit.  

The record for acceleration, though, is measured along ""the direction
you're facing"" (for lack of a better term).  As I recall, this record
was set in rocket sleds back in the 60's -- and was about 40 g's or so.",2

Well, here goes.

The first item of business is to establish the importance space life
sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind.  I mean compared
to football and baseball, the average joe schmoe doesn't seem interested
or even curious about spaceflight.  I think that this forum can
make a major change in that lack of insight and education.

All of us, in our own way, can contribute to a comprehensive document
which can be released to the general public around the world.  The
document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long
term human habitation in space.

I believe that if any long-term space exploration program is to 
succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld
(i.e. the spacecraft).  Only through the careful analyses of engineering,
chemical, biological, and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created
to facilitate human life on a long-duration flight.

So, I would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective
methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies
which can be applied to long-duration spaceflight.  Such a detailed
literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates
and clearly important to existing space programs.

In essence, we would be dividing the space life science issues into
various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies.
This database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the
basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet, isunet,
and any other source!",2

Significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. Ablex Publishing
Corporation is planning a special volume on ""Shape Analysis"", scheduled
for this year.

This volume will be a part of ""Progress in Neural Networks,"" an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling, analysis, design and
application of neural networks. The primary aim of this volume is to
present, in a single volume, the most important achievements made on
this important topic, which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

Authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. Suggested topics include, but are not limited to: shape modelling,
shape estimation, shape recovery, shape representation, shape matching,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. Research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
Markov random field, mean field annealing, simulated annealing, graduated
non-convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

The paper should be tutorial in nature, self contained and preferably,
but not necessarily, about fifty double spaced pages in length. Please send
electronically (if you prefer, you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
an  abstract and an outline to
msuk@ima.enst.fr
by May 30, 1993. The full paper must be submitted by July 31, 1993 to:

I don't think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing/launch
in terms of stresses/misalignments/etc.  I would think of the reboost as
a gentile push, where a landing, then launch as two JOLTS which would
put more mechanical stress on the instruments.  Additionally, there might
be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden
landing.  Finally, probably some thought went into possible contamination 
problems if the instruments came back to earth.

Of course, the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid
something that might be done in one shuttle launch.  Here's hoping

"I am doing research on atheism, part of which involves field research here
on the net.  The following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
group, intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.  I would
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and
mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.  

First of all, I've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
variety of ways, with varying amounts of detail; it's possible to give 
succinct answers to most everything, but there's enough here to keep most of 
you typing for hours, I'm sure.  As much detail as you want to give me (I mean 
it) is great, but it's also important for me to have as broad a base of 
individuals as possible, so even minimal responses are far better than nothing
-- it's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.  

Secondly, I hope some of the questions don't come off as obnoxious; I know that
phrases like ""What would convince you of the existence of God"" imply that I am
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant Godless heathens.
In fact, I'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself, so my
use of ""God"" is a question of locution rather than ideology -- it's easier 
than just repeating ""a deity or higher power"" every time.  

Also, I tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like ""belief system""
although I know some of you might contend that you don't have ANY beliefs, but
are skeptical towards everything.  I understand; but you know what I mean.
Think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases 
required to get the precise idea across.  

Lastly, thanks!  Please fill out as much as you can, in as much detail as
you can, and send them to me.  My research and I thank you.  

---------------

Where would you place your beliefs, on the spectrum 
	Theism <--> Agnosticism <--> Weak Atheism <--> Strong Atheism?  
Feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.  


In what, if any, religious tradition were you raised?  Did you ever believe 
in the existence of a God?  (Several of the following questions presume 
that the answer to this is ""yes;"" if you've always been an atheist, or at
least never a theist, you may have to modify the question/answer somewhat.)


How serious was your/your family's involvement?  

How and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe?  

How and when did your ""final break"" with your beliefs, if any, occur?  I 
realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an ""event"" per se;
whatever the case, just describe it in whatever detail you wish.  


What contact with other atheists have you had; before and after (and during)
your ""conversion"" to atheism?  (Certainly your involvement with alt.atheism
counts -- how have net discussions affected your beliefs?)  

To what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your
beliefs?  Did you come by your beliefs through discussion, through
independent means, or by some combination of the two or other means?  


Are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
means (proofs of the non-existence of God, etc), or was it perhaps, at least 
in part, through other means (alienation from mainstream religion, etc)?  


To what extent do you feel you ""understand"" the universe through your beliefs?
What phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical
phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you 
feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs, and where are they lacking as 
an explanatory method?  

What would it take for you to question, or change, your beliefs?  What would
convince you of the existence of God, what would convince you of the 
plausibility of God's existence, and so forth?  How dynamic are your beliefs
-- are they constantly changing; have they stayed more or less the same for
some time?  

Are you involved in a career or education in science?  To what extent do you
think science has influenced your beliefs?  (Issac Asimov claimed that science
was the new ""secular religion,"" and that ""scientists are, in a very real sense,
the new priesthood.""  Do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi-
religious base, or even a religious element?)  

---------------

This survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals, but
also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose
ideas and histories could be very useful to me.  Would you be willing to have
me, on the basis of this survey, write you to find out more about you and your
beliefs?  If not, fine; your filling out the survey alone is great.  

---------------

Thanks again.  Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what
I'm doing with this data, or if you have anything to say in addition to what
I've asked about above.  ",0

The scientist creates the living creature to examine it, poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour.  He will kill it if it becomes a threat.  For

free of its confines and starts devouring the population.  The scientist
would not hesitate in killing it.

God creates us to be His loving companions.  He knows whether we are true in 
our love for Him or not.  And He lets us know the consequences of rejecting Him.
God cannot abide by sin.  By rejecting God, a person becomes an enemy of God,
one that must be killed by Him.  Note:  I say that God and God alone is
worthy to be Judge, Jury and Executioner.  We are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy.
 

God is God.  Who are we to question the Creator?  If you doubt God's doing
in certain situations, do you claim to know a better solution?  Would you

Sadly understandable...


Yes.

To be fair, you should really qualify this as semitic-western religions, but
you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.


Again, this should really be evaluated at a personal level.  For example, there
was only one Jesus (presumably), and he probably didn't say all that many
things, and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of Christian sects have
arisen.  Perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and
believes in Christ as in pantheism.  It would seem to go against the Bible, but
it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of ""personal
interpretation"".


This is a good point.  We have here the quintessential Christian: he sets up a
system of values/beliefs for himself, which work very well, and every
event/experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this
system.  However, we also have an individual who has the inability (at least
not without some difficulty) to change, which is important, because the problem
with such a system is the same as with any system: one cannot be open minded to
the point of ""testing hypotheses"" against the basic premise of the system
without destroying whatever faith is invested therein, unless of course, all
the tests fail.  In other words, the *fairer* way would be to test and evaluate
moralities without the bias/responsibility of losing/retaining a system.


Interesting, but again, when it seems to basically boil down to individual
nuances (although not always, I will admit, and probably it is the
mass-oriented divisions which are the most appalling), it becomes irrelevant,
unfortunately.


Granted


In which case the people become the bullets, and the religion, as the gun,
merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves, if I
may be so bold as to extend your similie?


Also understandable... ;)

INTRODUCTION

     From our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for
untold thousands of years. Ancient astronomers observed points of
light that appeared to move among the stars. They called these
objects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman
deities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;
Mercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and
beauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The
stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors
or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.

     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.
Fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were
discovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were
calculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device
called the telescope at the heavens and made startling
discoveries.

     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of
solar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World
War II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth's gravity
and travel to the Moon and to other planets.

     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then
human-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated
machines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the
Sun's environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys
while flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.

     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and
understanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight
and other ""senses"" of our automated spacecraft, color and
complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared
to Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.
And dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.

     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights
through the solar system as some of the most remarkable
achievements of the 20th century.
     

AUTOMATED SPACECRAFT

     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)
automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many
shapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and
specific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.

     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments
selected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems
for electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well
as for processing data and communicating with Earth.

     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft
instruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays
of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its
solar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for
backup and supplemental power.

     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed
millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a
planet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments
pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help
prevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to
control spacecraft.

     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a
constant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth's early seafarers
used the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to
maintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto
fixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a
spacecraft's scientific instruments pointed at the target body
and the craft's communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The
thrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed
of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at
the planned distance and on the proper trajectory.

     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to
study the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the
inner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These
three worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets
because they share a solid-rock composition.

     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA
employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the
Mariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later
missions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted
the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.

     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power
source. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had
two wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were
equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal
bodies.

     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus
spacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the
Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147
pounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the
program. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had
originally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The
Mariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components
left over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.

     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.
Interest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite
different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.

     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers
-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar
system. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took
anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.
Barring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first
human artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun's
light becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers
do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity
generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.

     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit
our neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin
Viking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather
stations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --
descendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers
from Earth and then studied martian features from above.

     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.
The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument
that allowed it to ""see"" through the planet's dense cloud cover
to study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried
four probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and
the main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --
radioed information about the planet's atmosphere during their
descent toward the surface.

     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including
Magellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet
Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being
developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed
examinations that will increase our understanding of our
neighborhood and our own planet.
     

The Sun

     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start
with the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing
approximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;
all of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up
to only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the
material left over from the Sun's formation. One hundred and nine
Earths would be required to fit across the Sun's disk, and its
interior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.

     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of
fusion. The temperature at the Sun's core is 15 million degrees
Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there
is 340 billion times Earth's air pressure at sea level. The Sun's
surface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees
Fahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.
At the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing
energy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams
of charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.

     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years
and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or
so. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium
into heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing
so large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a
""red giant,"" it will suddenly collapse into a ""white dwarf"" --
the final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion
years to cool off completely.

     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun's environment, but
none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately
two-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,
the Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft
have all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,
launched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and
the European Space Agency. After using Jupiter's gravity to
change its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun's polar
regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of
studies using nine onboard scientific instruments.

     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If
it were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly
never have developed on Earth.
     

Mercury

     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the
primary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on
November 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a
journey of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,
the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the
solar system's innermost planet on March 29, 1974.

     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the
best telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct
object lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the
Sun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is
visible on Earth's horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it
is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar
telescopes gave any hint of Mercury's surface conditions prior to
the voyage of Mariner 10.

     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an
ancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own
Moon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the
planet. These apparently were created when Mercury's interior
cooled and shrank, buckling the planet's crust. The cliffs are as
high as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310
miles).

     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak
magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the
density of Earth's atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon
and helium. When the planet's orbit takes it closest to the Sun,
surface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees
Fahrenheit) on Mercury's sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius
(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface
temperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --
is the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury
literally bakes and freezes at the same time.

     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a
slow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid
revolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury
solar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time
it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the
Sun! 

     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like
that of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich
core making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would
make Mercury's core larger, proportionally, than the Moon's core
or those of any of the planets.

     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two
additional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --
before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted
and the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same
local Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was
illuminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the
planet's surface.
     

Venus

     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary
neighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2
spacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more
than a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the
mysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,
plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus' surface,
romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to
rest.

     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839
kilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first
spacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured
Venus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much
closer to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544
miles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5's
instruments measured the planet's magnetic field, ionosphere,
radiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner
10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth
showing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.

     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were
launched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4
of the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first
spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.

     Five days later, the five separate components making up the
second spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the
Venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The
four small, independent probes and the main body radioed
atmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the
surface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the
probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to
transmit data for another hour.

     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and
density more closely than any other known planet. However,
spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For
example, Venus' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)
compared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other
planets.

     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus' atmosphere (95 times as
dense as Earth's) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of
Earth's atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus' atmosphere acts like a
greenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but
trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into
space. As a result, the planet's average surface temperature is
482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt
lead.

     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the
first means of seeing through the planet's dense cloud cover and
determining surface features over almost the entire planet.
NASA's Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in
orbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses
radar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images
of the surface.

     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic
features, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface
show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows
lying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar
Terra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At
one end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size
of Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain's flank is a
100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep
impact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are
named for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are
the exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million
years because there is no water and very little wind erosion.

     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the
result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics
on Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to
weaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing
the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like
the San Andreas Fault in California.

     Venus' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,
high-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At
speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,
the clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The
circulation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus'
slow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth's winds blow in
both directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six
alternating bands. Venus' atmosphere serves as a simplified
laboratory for the study of our weather.
     

Earth

     As viewed from space, our world's distinguishing
characteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses
and white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting
of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other
constituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor
life, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million
kilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the
Sun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter
just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.

     Our planet's rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give
rise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the
atmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation
coming from the Sun and other stars. Earth's atmosphere protects
us from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can
strike the surface. Active geological processes have left no
evidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon
after it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the
other newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in
the early days of the solar system.

     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our
home planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was
launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and
discovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen
radiation belts, surrounding Earth.

     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our
planet's magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by
the solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously
ejected from the Sun. We've learned that the magnetic field does
not fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now
know that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and
uneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and
contracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the
upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.

     Besides affecting Earth's weather, solar activity gives rise
to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged
particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic
field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's
magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are
known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.

     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in
space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These
watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous
global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and
contributes to a better understanding of Earth's complex weather
systems.

     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey
Earth's oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet's
health. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided
tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our
planet in dangerous ways.
     

The Moon

     The Moon is Earth's single natural satellite. The first
human footsteps on an alien world were made by American
astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless
companion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo
expeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and
Lunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.

     NASA's Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials
and data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the
lunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection
of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)
and consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.

     From this material and other studies, scientists have
constructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.
Rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3
billion years old. The first few million years of the Moon's
existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.
As a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into
different kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids
and smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode
Island or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created
basins hundreds of kilometers across.

     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four
billion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,
overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken
rock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to
melt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers
(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million
years -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose
from inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the
surface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas
that Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,
called maria, meaning seas.

     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant
volcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.
Since then, the lunar surface has been altered only by
micrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,
by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and
astronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion
years ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the
one today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the
Apollo crews will remain sharp and clear.

     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories
attempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate
body; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was
captured by our planet's gravity, or it was the result of a
collision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.
The last theory has some good support but is far from certain.
     

Mars

     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar
system's prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.
Astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what
appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These
observations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led
to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a
system of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson
Welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction
classic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed
in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.

     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to
do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet's
surface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might
support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months
and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.

     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.
Four Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one
placed into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively
before the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.

     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,
1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the
surface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the
planet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring
channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.
Mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of
1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a
diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry
atmosphere of carbon dioxide.

     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a
mission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The
spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to
find Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made
surface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the
storm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329
pictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,
including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across
the surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.

     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft
-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from
Kennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several
questions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?
Nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was
hoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at
least find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.

     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully
touch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,
while the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos
sent back from the Chryse Planitia (""Plains of Gold"") showed a
bleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the
lander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked
by rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives
the sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia
Planitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape
than the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible
dunes.

     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking
Lander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil
were tested in three different experiments designed to detect
biological processes. While some of the test results seemed to
indicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this
activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet's soil
chemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the
Viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist
there.

     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind
velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and
pressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest
temperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7
degrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.

     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees
Fahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2
site during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at
the two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but
because the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking
Lander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably
water-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.

     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily
carbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small
percentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much
water as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,
forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around
the slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning
fog can form in valleys.

     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian
atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical
features closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and
islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.

     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and
irregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is
possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too
close to Mars and were captured by its gravity.

     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins
their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The
first to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on
July 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.
Viking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut
down because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on
August 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was
used up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.

     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology
experiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except
Earth. NASA's Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in
September 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian
environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. 
     

Asteroids

     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic
objects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be
considered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as
asteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a
band or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have
orbits that cross Earth's path, and there is evidence that Earth
has been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,
best preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near
Winslow, Arizona.

     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the
solar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a
planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More
likely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a
planet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was
gathered into a single object, the object would be only about
1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the
diameter of our Moon. 

     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It
is estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be
photographed through Earth-based telescopes.

     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from
examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of
Earth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are
called meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at
high velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to
incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the
meteoroid does not burn up completely, what's left strikes
Earth's surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places
to look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.

     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of
silicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and
nickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony
meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much
like terrestrial rocks.

     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar
system, scientists are interested in their composition.
Spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found
that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are
separated by very large distances.

     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids
for closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in
October 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to
Jupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini
missions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for
launch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini
missions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as
well as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.
One day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw
materials.
     

Jupiter

     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of
our solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four
spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these
colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter
was the first port of call.

     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in
March 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid
belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In
December 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,
flying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet's
banded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1
and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned
spectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites
during flybys in 1979.

     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of
liquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere
composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice
crystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps
phosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that
characterize Jupiter's atmosphere.

     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases
react to form organic molecules in the regions between the
planet's frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying
below. Because of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics, however, these
organic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.

     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through
telescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter's
atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a
high-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction
opposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is
surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and
are sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a
million years old.

     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter's upper
atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth's
northern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned
the first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.

     Largest of the solar system's planets, Jupiter rotates at a
dizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The
massive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey
around the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a
miniature solar system.

     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under
way. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once
past Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two
asteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into
Jupiter's cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo
Orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close
to Jupiter's large moons, exploring in detail what the two
Pioneers and two Voyagers revealed.
     

Galilean Satellites

     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and
spotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first
time, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of
their discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the
Galilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily
traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs
returned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these
planet-sized satellites.

     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission
was the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.
Volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world
other than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine
active volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending
as far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon's surface.

     Io's pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow
hues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to
the surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this
satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the
gravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three
Galilean moons.

     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the
brightest Galilean satellite. The moon's surface displays a
complex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been
fractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa
has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --
apparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered
by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the
cold of space. Europa's core is made of rock that sank to its
center.

     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and
Callisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest
satellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury
and Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or
ice and the rest rock. Ganymede's surface has areas of different
brightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of
the moon's interior and was deposited at various locations on the
surface.

     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the
lowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large
amounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the
most heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity
during its history has erased old craters except more impacts.

     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be
performed by the Galileo Orbiter.
     

Saturn

     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its
exquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is
composed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors
and wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn's atmosphere
has a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted
by high-altitude haze. Given Saturn's somewhat placid-looking
appearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity
equatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100
miles) per hour.

     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11
sped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,
returning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in
November 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that
revealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn's ring
system and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in
August 1981.

     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles
orbiting individually around Saturn's equator at progressive
distances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves
passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely
in size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are
bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.

     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body
ventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been
torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its
interior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin
with and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn's gravity. A
third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions
with larger objects orbiting the planet.

     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each
other, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by
the gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These
complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets
that make up the major rings.

     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM
car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager
spacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are
believed to be coming from Saturn's ring system rather than its
atmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at
Jupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth's auroras near
Saturn's poles.

     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several
satellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons
shepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn's rings and the gaps
in the rings. Saturn's 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from
images taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. 

     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based
atmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth's in
composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and
Venus. Titan's surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290
degrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands
rising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.
Unfortunately, Voyager's cameras could not penetrate the moon's
dense clouds.

     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be
converting Titan's methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in
combination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter
compound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may
be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth
between three and four billion years ago. However, Titan's
atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit
progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.

     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini
mission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will
also deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into
Titan's atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the
probe as well as radar to peer through Titan's clouds and will
spend years examining the Saturnian system.
     

Uranus

     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting
Saturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the
Uranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about
Uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from
ground observations since the planet's discovery over two
centuries ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.

     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the
solar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of
Pluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and
south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing
around the solar system. During Voyager 2's flyby, the south pole
faced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an
Earth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the
solar system.

     Voyager 2 found that Uranus' magnetic field does not follow
the usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,
the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet's
center, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one
magnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of
Djakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.

     Uranus' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12
percent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water
vapor. The planet's blue color occurs because methane in its
atmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580
kilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud
tops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).

     Uranus' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of
photochemical ""smog"" believed to be a combination of acetylene,
ethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the
planet's atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into
space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as ""electroglow.""

     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus'
cloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and
dissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.
Beneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.

     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105
miles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --
Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from
520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing
a geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock
spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past
activity, including faulting and ice flows.

     The most remarkable of Uranus' moons is Miranda. Its surface
features high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and
winding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,
after the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with
another body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which
contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments
from large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda
apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in
its interior exposed on its surface.

     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged
11. In contrast to Saturn's rings, which are composed of bright
particles, Uranus' rings are primarily made up of dark,
boulder-sized chunks.
     

Neptune

     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system
with an investigation of Neptune and the planet's moons. On
August 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers
(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.
During the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet's
atmosphere was more active than Uranus'. 

     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the
size of Earth, in Neptune's atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter's
Great Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves
westward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager
2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed
the ""Scooter,"" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main
hydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any
planet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per
hour.

     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen
and helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet's core
contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the
other gas giants. Neptune's distinctive blue appearance, like
Uranus' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.

     Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet's
spin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is
similar to Uranus' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of
the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,
where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the
electrical properties of a metal. Earth's magnetic field, on the
other hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only
slightly tilted and offset relative to its center.

     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune's rings.
Observations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of
material in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how
Neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from
spreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected
these arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.
A number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies
were not spotted.

     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in
1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new
moons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since
Proteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet's
glare for observers on Earth.

      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six
days. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly
towards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in
astronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian
gravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to
accompany the planet's modest current rings.

     Triton's landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of
Io and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at
Saturn and Uranus. Triton's mantle is probably composed of
water-ice, but the moon's crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and
methane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of
terrain: the so-called ""cantaloupe"" terrain and a receding ice
cap. 

     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the
fallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas
and dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers
(1 to 5 miles). Triton's thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as
thick as Earth's, has winds that carry the dark particles and
deposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet
found in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees
Fahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other
object spacecraft have so far visited.
     

Pluto

     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the
eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside
Neptune's orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will
remain until March 1999. Pluto's orbit is also highly inclined --
tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.

     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a
celestial snowball. The planet's diameter is calculated to be
approximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the
size of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto's
surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin
atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet
moves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto's spin
axis is tipped by 122 degrees. 

     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in
1978. Charon's surface composition is different from Pluto's: the
moon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane
ice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both
bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto's
and Charon's rotational period and Charon's period of revolution
are all 6.4 Earth days. 

     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is
currently exploring the possibility of such a mission.
     

Comets

     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a
visit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and
metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets
are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only
far from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a
loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching
perhaps halfway to the nearest star.

     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are
gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close
to the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer
planets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually
warm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner
planets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself
is irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally
of water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar
to those composing the moons of the giant planets.

     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma
or cloud-like ""head"" that can measure tens of thousands of
kilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the
Sun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes
on this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving
rise to the comet's ""tails."" Gases and ions are blown directly
back from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.
As the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are
left behind in a curved arc.

     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in
effect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.
The tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in
length, but the total amount of material contained in this
dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --
from the Latin cometa, meaning ""long-haired"" -- are essentially
dramatic light shows.

     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but
others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close
encounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter
visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return
to the inner solar system.

     Halley's Comet is the most famous example of a relatively
short period comet, returning on an average of once every 76
years and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus' orbit.
Confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular
visitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,
because he plotted the comet's orbit and predicted its return,
based on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name
became part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet
returned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to
see it.

     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes
comparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent
appearance, Halley's Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million
kilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was
visible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern
hemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so
bright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.
Historically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens
and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.

     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will
become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and
remain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF
will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing
sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and
form a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at
high speed; the first was NASA's International Cometary Explorer
in 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet
and the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by
Halley's Comet in 1986.
     

Conclusion

     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of
space through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had
only one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,
spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our
neighbors in space. 

     We have learned more about our solar system and its members
than anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated
spacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets
beyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large
as small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar
environment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of
bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for
generations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange
and beautiful places and objects.

     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar
system has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and
meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called
comparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,
moons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and
similarities, we are learning more about the origin and history
of these bodies and the solar system as a whole.

     We are also gaining insight into Earth's complex weather
systems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by
investigating the Sun's activity and its influence throughout the
solar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and
processes on Earth.

     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated
spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission
is mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach
the Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future
missions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid
belt.

     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once
again set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not
been back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being
formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the
human exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian
outposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a
lunar base or a martian colony!",2
"It should be noted that the US benefitted not only from German science and
technology after WW2 but also from British science and technology. From the
discovery and manufacture of penicillin to jet engines, swing wing aircraft,
the hovercraft etc etc. all were shipped lock-stick-and-barel across the
Atlantic. We still are suffering from this sort of thing because of some of the
more parochial aspects of US procurement policy. Meiko, a British 
parallel computer company, for example, has now moved most of its facilities to
the US since that was the only way it could sell stuff over there.

From the Pluto Fast Flyby Instrument definition research anouncemnet,
the instrument payload constraints are:
    Mass allocation -  7 kilograms (15.4 lbs)
    Power allocation - 6 watts
    Required instruments:
	Visible imaging system (1024x1024 CCD, 750 mm fl, f/10 optics)
	IR mapping spectrometer (256x256 HgCdTe array, 0.3% energy resolution)
	UV spectrometer (55-200 nm, 0.5 nm resolution)
	Radio science (ultrastable oscilator incorporated in telecom system)
		ultrastable means 10^-14.

This doesn't leave much room for payloads which are totally unrelated
to the  mission of the spacecraft.  In addition, the power will come
from a radioisotope thermal generator, and the whole space craft will
be about 2 feet in diameter, with no booms, which means there will be
strong gamma-lines from Pu-239 and associated schmutz in the
background, which tends to reduce sensitivity somewhat.

It would still be nice, and our group here at Goddard is looking
in to it.

Well for starters, why use rle files?  You might have a specific program that
needs them, OK, but I tend to convert straight to jpeg format, thus a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becomes a ~80k or less 24bit jpeg.

The latest versions of XV (2.2.1 ?) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
And the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c/djpeg suit.  Even at 90%
quality (you can't see the difference) the jpeg is way smaller than anything
else even an 8bit gif!

Well, I'll avoid your question for now (got some learnin' to do) with a
promise to come back with more info when I can find it.  I _do_ know that
BATSE is the primary instrument in the development of the all-sky map of
long-term sources.  Given that fact, and the spacecraft attitude knowledge
of approx. 2 arcmin, we might be able to figure out how well BATSE can
determine the location (rotational) of a Gamma Ray burster from knowledge
of the all-sky map's accuracy.  PR material for the other three instruments
give accuracies on the order of ""fractions of a degree"", if that's

Do you know of the world-wide-web?  This is a global hypertext (well,

I'd hardly call the current Pluto Fast Flyby proposal ""too large"" (if the
new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds, the S/C mass will
drop to 110-120 kg) or ""too expensive"" ($400 million [FY92 $] for two S/C),
especially when compared to other NASA planetary missions.


This proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and
the require minimal delta-v from the mother ship.  A mission to the main belt
might be one possibility for such a mission -- I recall a paper being presented
at an AIAA deisgn conference in Irvine in February where such a proposed
spacecraft was designed by some grad students at UT Austin (I think).  Four
mini-spacecraft would detatch from the main S/C, each visiting a seperate
asteroid and then returning to the main S/C.  After analysis, the main S/C
would then be targeted for the most ""interesting"" object for further study.

Now, if I could only *find* that paper...  =)

"About three weeks ago on the SPACE list, someone was quoting a source on the

like to know the source of the rankings list.  If anybody still has that
discussion on their disk or knows the source (or is the poster himself!)
I'd appreciate getting that reference.  Being on the road I have temporarily

If the children are not being fed, whose fault is that?  You and I

God gave us this earth to manage.  I don't think we're doing a very

The problem is that the process is inherently complicated ! The IJG's code is
pretty good if you ask me, and I have watched it go through many many cycles of
revision.

Try getting a good book on the subject, that will explain the algorithms.

BTW. I presume your comment about ""good"" code wasn't meant to sound as offensive
as it does.

14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)

PLPLOT
------
  PLPLOT is a scientific plotting package for many systems, small (micro)
  and large (super) alike.  Despite its small size and quickness,
  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:
  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,
  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or
  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each
  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually
  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are
  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.  This includes four
  different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of mathematical, musical, and
  other symbols.  The fonts can be scaled to any size for various effects.
  Many different output device drivers are available (system dependent),
  including a portable metafile format and renderer.

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

  707-579-1733

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily
  extensible through ""script"" (or indirect command) files. These script
  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are
  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.
  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame
  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides
  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.""

  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200

Satellite Image Workshop
------------------------
  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all
  sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-
  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't
  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1

  ""An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image
  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.""

  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of
  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.""

  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Dimple
------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

  ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

  as fast or as powerful, though I have had only limited experience with
  Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good
  starter program except for the obtuse manual""

IMAGINE-32
----------
  It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called ""Imagine32""
  or ""Image32"" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
  subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
  It can also display a number of images simultaneously.
  The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. 

PC Vista
--------
  It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to
  be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been

	richmond@bllac.berkeley.edu
	richmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu

  and his s-mail address is:

  Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720

  The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source
  code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and
  a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code,
  you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work,
  but will require substantial modifications.

  To receive the documentation and nine double-density (360K) floppies
  (or three quad-density 3-1/2 inch floppies (1.44M) with everything on them,
  just send a request for PC-Vista, together with your name and a US-Mail
  address, to 

	Office of Technology Licensing
	2150 Shattuck Ave., Suite 510
	Berkeley, Ca. 94704

  Include a check (Traveller's Checks are fine) or purchase order for $150.00
  in U.S. dollars, if your address is inside the continental U.S., or $165.00
  otherwise, made out to Regents of the University of California
  to cover duplication and mailing costs.


SOFTWARE TOOLS
--------------
  It's a set of software ""tools"" put out by Canyon State
  Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I
  heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber
  software. 

MIRAGE
------
  It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the
  Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.
  It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image
  processing displaying functions built in. 

DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK
----------------------------
  The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book
  containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is
  compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.
  Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.

MAXEN386
--------
  A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does
  maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital
  Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is
  mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92
  (an article on CCD's vs film). 

JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA)
------------------------
  Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific. 
  Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,
  (800) 874-1888.

Microbrian
----------
  Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card
  (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of
  super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing
  system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use
  a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.
  Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System. It was developed by
  CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Organization) and is
  marketed/ supported by:

  MPA Australia (51 Lusher Road, Croydon, Victoria
  tel + 61 3 724 4488     fax  +61 3 724 4455)

  There are educational and commercial prices, but be prepared to set
  aside $A10k for the first educational licence.  Subsequent ones come
  cheaper (they need to!) It has installed sites worldwide.  It is widely
  used at ANU.

MicroImage
----------
  The remote sensing lab here at Dartmouth currently uses Terra-Mar's
  MicroImage, on 486 PCs with some fancy display hardware.

Unix-based tools
================

IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility)
--------------------------------------------
  Developed in the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Kitt Peak AZ
  It is free, you can ftp it from tucana.noao.edu [140.252.1.1]
  and complement it with STSDAS from stsci.edu [130.167.1.2].
  Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.
  Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical
  image community. They issue a newsletter also.
  They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last
  I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.

  It's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.
  Very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of
  documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.

ALV
---
  A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to
  comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to
  alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few. 

LABOimage
---------
  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently
  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.
  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.
  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), 
  medicine, biology, physics. It is distributed free of charge (source code).

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

Global Imaging Software
-----------------------
  ""We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to
  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display""

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.
o  interactive or specified image offset computation and re-sampling for
   registration.
o  interactive with 1-d image: zoom in x- y- or both in steps of 1/2 or
   2 times current, re-center plot, or enlarge a framed area. 4 plot buffers
   can be cycled through. Interactive data analysis: polynomial fitting,
   point deletion, undelete, change value, point weighting, linear and
   quadratic loess and binomial smoothing, revert to unit point weights
   or original data buffer, substitute results into data buffer for pass
   back to calling function. Dump data buffer (+ overlays and error bars)
   to file or printer.  Change to user specified coordinate system.
o  Tricolor image combination and display, hardcopy halftone printout to
   HP-PCL compatible printers (Laserjet, deskjet, etc.)
o  Documentation is over 300 pages in custom vinyl binder.

Yes, one does.  I examined a critique of the Book of Romans by
I think, Benjamin Franklin once, a Deist.  I found it amazing that
Benjamin Franklin missed the whole boat.   I also have the writings
on Thomas Jefferson sitting on my shelf, and it is amazing how
much he missed.  I have studied Plato's Theory of Forms and 
Aristotelian Hylomorphesism.  What a pile of junk.  Jesus
makes Plato and Aristotle look like kindergardeners.  Psychology,
the id, ego, superego by Freud?  Elements of truth, but Jesus
explained it far better and gave reasons.

Thomas Paine, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson are mere men.  They
can screw up the Bible just as well as any man.  I do not put these
men on a pedestal.  And if I remember T.J.'s autobiography correctly,
he thought Thomas Paine was the most unread man he ever met.

Here's some more circular reasoning to you.  Paul says to the Corinthians
that ""that the gospel will be foolishness to the world, because it is 
spiritually discerned.""  And so, people without the spirit of God haven't a
clue to what the Bible is saying.   From your point of view, that's
incredibly circular and convenient.   To me, it is mysteriously and supernaturally
bizarre.   I can see it, but you can't.  This is not arrogance on
my part.  Trust me.  It is as bizarre to you as it is to me.  But nonetheless,
it is a truth, explainable or not.

Are any of you color blind to red and green?  I am.  Remember those
dot tests they do at the optomologist's?  They put pictures in front
of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots?  If
your eyes are perfectly normal, you can see letters or numerals
embedded in the dots.  They are a slightly different color and stand
out from the background.  But if you are color blind to red and green,
you will not see anything but gray-shaded dots.  That is how a dot
test appears to me.  I do not see a pattern at all.

A normal seeing person will see the patterns.  And to him, I seem like a
total anomaly.  To him, I appear as if I am missing the universe or something.
It is hard for him to understand why I can't see anything
that to him is as plain as day.

That it what it is like with the Bible, the Word of God, to the believer.
The believer can see the meaning in the words.  I can see how the patterns
fit together.  There is such depth.  Such consistency.   But then, on the
other hand, I notice the non-believer.   He doesn't see it.  He thinks
I am weird because he thinks I am seeing things.   I look at him, and
say, ""No, you are weird.  You do not see.""   Then it is time for a sanity
check.  I go to another Christian and say, ""Do you see this.""  And
they go, ""Yes.  It is an ""X"""".  And I say, ""Thank God, I see the ""X""
too.""

It is truly the strangest thing.   It adds a little extra dimension to
the phrase, 

         ""He will make the blind see, and the deaf hear.""

Much of the Haight-Ashbury crowd probably had pre-existing

   As opposed to Universal or Catholic or ""FourSquare Gosple"". I think that
   the Greek Orthodox Church would take high offense at your misuse of the
   word. Your version of Christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived
   you make claims of bible-centricity that are not derivable soley from the
   Bible.  About six-seven months ago, you claimed that your primary objection
   to the LDS was that ""our"" doctrine was not bible-derived, And now this
   (and other) claims can be shown, are also not bible interpeting bible.


 
	Simple truths... oh for example?   



       ""paradise exalted to heaven""

	paradise wasn't equal to heaven and _now_ it is? Yet you claim that
 	peeple can not be exalted to heaven, nicht wahr?


	When I read the story, I found that  ""Abraham's Bosom"" wasn't so much
	a place, but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to Abraham?

	Gee this is fairly close to what the LDS call spirit prison, and what
        you have called false doctrine...

    [ vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the SunSpot Gopher Archive ]

 

   This part is _not_ supported from scripture, nor does it support your
   claim that the ""paradise"" where Christ descended was exalted.

   Making such claims on this little ""evidence"" ignores the witness of the
   scripture

   Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison, is now changed from
   a Pre-Easter postion to post-easter by God postion is not supportable.
 
   Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...




  Yes, and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading
  of the scriptures. You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural 
  ""proof"" need to be cross-checked. The referencs that you supply often do
  not support your postion, if they are read in the context of the scripture.



	How about that those who have been in paradise, and have accepted
	the gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ, and then return to the
	presence of God. Is that somehow different from your expressed view
	that the paradise spoken of (or ""Abraham's Bosom"")
	Should we go back and discuss your view on why the Angle of the Lord
	is the Lord again... ;-)

I'm curious to know if Christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion, classical text such as ""Age of Reason"" by Paine,
or ""The Myth Maker"" by Jacobi. Sometimes it is good to know your
enemy, and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides, and not solely the one and only right one.

 I have a copy of 'The Earth-From Space' on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots, Inc. (LA, CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the
poster, the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project.
The image IS copyrighted, so I doubt that you'll find it legally in
the public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is
nominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also, I don't think it's always
safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any
products will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA, NOAA)
and some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project.  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public, rather than pure research.",1

This is, shall we say, an overly-broad statement.  In particular, are you
referring to the native American culture that existed in 1400, or the one
that existed in 1800?  (Simplify things by assuming we're talking about
the eastern US rather than the whole continent.)  Given that those were
*radically* different cultures, which one are you referring to?


Note that the pre-Columbian native Americans, east of the Mississippi,
did all of these things.  (Well, maybe not ""on Sunday"", but they did
have organized religions, not to mention cities and governments.)  If
you are judging the native Americans by the tribal culture that existed
in 1800, you might want to read an account of the De Soto expedition
to find out what pre-Columbian native American culture, at least in the
more civilized parts of the continent, was like.",2

sham to sneak in prayers, then it MUST be opposed.  What the HELL have
prayers to do with public schooling?  [I ask this question as a devout
Christian.]



Their kids can bloody-well pray any God-damned time they WANT to.  And
nothing, on heaven or earth, in government or the principal's office,
can prevent or in any other way deal with their doing so.  *Especially*
if the prayer is silent (as bursting out into the ""Shema Yisrael"" or
some other prayer *might* be construed as disruptive if audible :-))
No one ever prevented ME from praying in public school!  They hardly
even prevented me from masturbating in study hall.

I should have thought better of someone posting from a UChicago address.
How can you manage to say such nonsense without shame?

Muslim students might have a complaint, if they are prevented from setting
out their rugs and doing the proper ablutions before prayer at the times
specified in the Qu'ran.  Jews would probably like the opportunity to daven
with tefillim and whatever else *they* require, at *their* appropriate times.
I do not see THEM complaining (though Muslims and Jews have a case that no
Christian I have ever heard has been able to make.)

The ""Christian"" insistence on a PUBLIC, UNIVERSAL, ENFORCED ""moment of
prayer^H^H^H^H^H^Hsilence"" is nothing but the Inquisition ""naturalized""
into the American context.  It is offensive to the Gospel of Christ.",3
": I have a little question:

: I need to convert RGB-coded (Red-Green-Blue) colors into HVS-coded

Lets see if I have this right... HSV == HSB == HSL ... and none of those
are the same as HLS.  Hopefully, HVS is just a transposition of HSV, and
not yet another color model... 

The following code should do the HSV (HSL) coding (I haven't tried it yet)

Andrew,

The myth to which I refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have
created to make religion appear absurd. Rather than approach religion
(including Christainity) in a rational manner and debating its claims
-as the are stated-, atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then
hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don't have. What is
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like, reasonable atheist.

doctrine (as I understand it), if I am speaking for myself you'll know
it. My purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of Christain

point, your dispute is not with me ...

Bill

: 1) No, they don't have to ignore the Bible.  The Bible is far

: 2) There are people who have truly never heard of the Bible.

: 3) Again, read the FAQ.

1) Here again you miss the point. The Bible itself is not the point,
it's what it contains. It makes no difference who accpets the Bible or
even who's unaware of its existence, Christians hold that it applies
universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate
and the same innate knowledge of God.

2) See above

3) If you read my post with same care as read the FAQ, we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

Yes, human reason does always come back to the existence of God, we're
having this discussion are we not?

    What do you accept as a fact --  the roundness of the earth (after

it was a spheroid, and now people say it's a geoid [?])?  yourself

criteria?).

    ""Gravity is _not_ a fact"": is that a fact?  How about Newton's 
and Einstein's thoughts about gravity -- is it a fact that they had 
those thoughts?  I don't see how any of the things that you are

evolution.

I disagree with what to tout, although I agree that the space program is
inherently a good thing.  Most people today only care about ""what will it
cost me?"" and ""what's in it for me?"" and could care less about whether
something is simply worthwhile in and of itself.  Our society has become
increasingly geared toward the short-term (which you could read as NOW!). 
They couldn't care less about next week, much less next century.  They want
something to show for the expenditure and they want it *now*.

I think we *should* tell them about the things that they are using now that
are spinoffs of the space program.  That is the only way you can *prove*
its worth to *them* - and they vote and pay taxes too.  The continued

Reboost may not be a problem, if they have enough fuel.  If they don't do a 
reboost this time, they will definitely have to do one on the next servicing
mission.  But try to land a shuttle with that big huge telescope in the 
back and you could have problems.  The shuttle just isn't designed to land 
with that much weight in the payload.


of course that is a concern too, and the loss of science during the time
that it is on the ground.  plus a fear that if it comes down, some
big-wig might not allow it to go back up.  but the main concern, I
believe is the danger of the landing.  Just to add another bad vibe,
they also increase the risk of damaging an instrument.  Finally, 
this is a chance for NASA astronanuts to prove they could build and
service a space station.  Hubble was designed for in flight servicing.

bringing the telescope down, to my understanding, was considered
even very recently, but all these factors contribute to the 
decision to do it the way it was planned in the beginning.

"-*----

Far from being ""tossed out,"" the gospels are taken, almost
universally, as the primary source of information about Jesus.
I am curious as to whom Mike Cobb is referring.  Who ""tosses out""
the New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,
but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb
ascribes this more broadly.

Perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is
why, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far
outnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels
*not* taken as ""gospel truth"" that faithfully records just what
happened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and
the answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken
this way by a critical reader.

There is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,
measures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the
text as ""historically valid"" or ""tosses out"" the text.  I suspect
this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and
secondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,
and from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present
historical arguments along these lines for their religious
program.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary
school history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better
such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed
above, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if
it bit him on the keister twice.

Let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts
and their use in studying history.  First, all texts are
historically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I
have never seen a notion of ""historical validity"" that makes any
sense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as
telling the ""gospel truth"" about historical events, in the way
that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and
secondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite
author's history of whatever.)

Every text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some
person (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every
text can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can
we learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does
the text provide evidence?

The diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of
Oregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical
evidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the 
vampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The
modern American history textbooks that whitewash ""great American
figures"" are historical evidence.  These are all historical
evidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all
that the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that
Jesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that ""great
American figures"" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.
They are better evidence that some people ""saw"" the Maharishi,
late of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians
thought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe
""saw"" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an
educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather
than teach history.

How does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of
historical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a
very complex question that has no easily summarized answer.
There are many books on the subject or various parts of the
subject.  I enjoy David Hackett Fischer's ""Historian's Fallacies""
as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy
to read texts present history.  It's relatively cheap.  It's easy
to read.  Give it a try.",3

   could produce X11 output of HPGL file on RS/6000. And same kind of
   software who could produce hardcopy on postscript and lasetjet.

Try export.lcs.mit.edu.  I think that there is a viewer there called
xviewgl.  Check the README in /contrib.

"MC> Theory of Creationism: MY theistic view of the theory of
MC> creationism, (there  are many others) is stated in Genesis
MC> 1.  In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

And which order of Creation do you accept?	The story of creation is one of the
many places in the Bible where the Story contradicts itself.  The following is
an example...

GEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle 
after  their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.
GEN 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image,  after  our likeness: 
and  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of
the air, and over the cattle, and  over  all the  earth,  and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

GEN 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is  not  good  that  the  man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
GEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the 
field,  and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
would call them: and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature, that was
the name thereof.

Even your Bible cannot agree on how things were created.  Why should we
believe in it?",0
"


Of course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever
felt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.
This is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear
of getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did
not answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,
a lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint
of her existence.


I suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe
and analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the
opposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.

I'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this
group two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,
I decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional
responses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only
a couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,
thank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit
that I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.


I used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what
other people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I
read. I learned what it means to use _reason_.

As a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments
like this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload
considerably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first
attempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: 

No matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,
it may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take
a leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. 
But it can still be wrong. 

I found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism
to believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, 
filtering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god
playing any part. 


Oh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better
documented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented
quite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,
the end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.

Jesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.


This is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I
observe. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the
evidence. 

It makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.
I assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.


A liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible
again. 

I was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered
as heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm
lying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is 
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not
do so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.

Blind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.
But if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just
don't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,
it looks like she doesn't.

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.",1

Hmm, it seems that this is the core of Christianity then, you 
have to feel guilty, and then there's this single personality
that will save you from this universal guilt feeling.

Brian, I will tell you a secret, I don't feel guilty at all,
I do mistakes, and I regret them, however I've never had this
huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

If things happen wrong, I will try to learn from the mistakes
and go on.

This all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines. And if your personality type is 
opposite, then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system.


All I know is that I don't know everything. And frankly speaking
I don't care, life is fun anyway. I recognize that I'm not 
perfect, but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
and inspiring life.

There are humans that subscribe to the same notion. The nice
thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden,

Its just variation within a thread.  The variation at times has been so great
that speciation has occurred.  So Albert Sabin is the common ancestor of
several threads, some of which have themselves speciated.  On a separate topic,
I subscribed to t.o. just recently.  Albert Sabin existed at that time, so I
have no clue as to its origins.  Maybe the abiogenesists have an answer.  I
might also point out that evolution is aimless.  Thus why Albert 
Sabin evolved into a religious discussion is probably unexplainable.",3

There would be some point to doing long-term monitoring of things like
particles and fields, not to mention atmospheric phenomena.  However,
there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network.
To be precise, there is no particular plan, period.  This is a large
part of the problem.  In this context, it's not surprising that unexciting
but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time.  The closest
approach to any sort of long-term planetary monitoring mission is the
occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier
mission like Galileo or Cassini.


It is most unlikely that there is much happening on Pluto that would be
worth monitoring, and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly
without new propulsion technology (something the planetary community
has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for).  The combined need to
arrive at Pluto within a reasonable amount of time, and then kill nearly
all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit, is beyond what can
reasonably be done with current (that is, 1950s-vintage) propulsion.


Most of this can be done just about as well from Earth.  The few things
that can't be, can be done better from a Voyager-like spacecraft that is
*not* constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet.",2

The thing is, I know what arms and legs are.  It's therefore generally easy to
tell whether or not someone has arms and legs.  This ""sinful nature"", since it
does not require that the baby actually perform any sins, seems to be totally
invisible.  As far as I know, maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and
half don't--it'd look exactly the same, since there is no way to tell the
difference.


So what's so bad about a sinful nature, then?  I could understand it being
bad if it always results in people committing sins, but babies can have it,
never commit sins, die, and they still have it.  So the bad part about can't
merely be that it results in people committing sins--so what _is_ bad about it?

Hi everyone,
           I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,
do you still think that just believing is enough?'

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.
But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)
as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'

Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.-- 

in Christ,

Will

We have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes
that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly
considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil 
rights. Among these are drug abuse, sexual perversion, and political 
incorrectness.
Today Billary accused Koresh of having SEX with infants. He had been accused of
a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months, but 
this is the first time I have heard that one. I had heard child abuse but
this is somewhat stronger.
It is fairly obvious that Koresh  was hiding behind the children; and ironicly
considering his apocalyptic dread, believed enough in the American People's
inherent goodness to believe he was protected.
It is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of 
the Branch Davidian now believe that he was suicidal, crazy, a child abuser and 
a immenant danger to others based solely on what the Government spokespersons
had said. Remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found
that they have screwed up. 
But they don't have as much to lose as David Koresh and his followers lost.
For in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes.

Speaking of SIGGRAPH, I just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for SIGGRAPH and re-upping of membership in the ACM last night, and was I ever
grossed out!  The new prices for membership are almost highway robbery!

For example:

	SIGGRAPH basic fee went from $26 last year to $59 this year for the same
	thing, a 127% increase.  Those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
	annual conference could reduce this to $27 by selecting SIGGRAPH Lite,
	which means SIGGRAPH is charging an additional $32 (or so) for the
	proceedings and the art show catalog, essentially.

	TOPLAS went up 40% in cost, way outstripping the current inflation rate.

	Basic SIGCHI fees remainded the same, but whereas before SIGCHI
	membership included UIST and Human Factors conferences proceedings,
	these are now an extra cost option.  Bundling that back into the basic
	rate, equivalent services have gone up 100% in cost.

	SIGOIS membership cost has up 33%, but they've also split out the
	Computer Supported Cooperative Work conference proceedings that used to
	be included with membership.  Adding that cost back in means this SIG
	also has doubled its membership fee.

What really galls me is that the ACM sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services, and tried to make it
sound like they were offering NEW services.  But with the exception of a couple,
like SIGGRAPH, all the ""plus"" services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they don't look so big.  But their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying 90% more than last year for a 31%
increase in services (measured by cost, not by value), and, curiously, a 31%
inflation rate on the publications I got last year.

Is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as I am?

SHOOTING YOURSELF IN THE FOOT IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES AND SYSTEMS",1
"(sci.space readers can skip the first paragraph)

  Yesterday, in response to Henry Spencer's question about the 
temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space, I said ""Dust grains
acts as blackbodies, and they're at 40-150 K.""  Well, I was dead
wrong.  Our local interstellar dust expert, Bruce Draine, has
informed me that dust grains _aren't_ good radiators in the far IR,
which is why they are so warm; actually, the ambient radiation field
from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 Kelvin.
Sorry, Henry, and anyone else I misled.  Obviously, time for me to
take another ISM class :-(

  In other news, Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute gave
a talk on the Pluto-Charon binary system yesterday.  He gave a brief
overview of the currently-accepted system parameters (volume ratio of
about 8:1, mass ratio about 15:1 or so, plus lots more...) and then
gave his thoughts on the formation of Pluto-Charon.  His idea is 
that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer
solar system, with masses distributed as a power law of some kind;
over time, the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies.  Most got
scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with Jupiter
and Saturn, but many accreted into the gas giants, especially
Uranus and Neptune.  A large planetesimal was captured by Neptune -
we call it Triton [captured how?  Perhaps by a collision with a smaller,
already-existing Neptunian moon, perhaps by a very close passage through
Neptune's atmosphere - mondo aerobraking!].

  He notes that the two recently discovered ""Kuiper Belt"" objects,
1992 QB1 and 1993 FW, plus Chiron and Pholus, are all about the same 
mass, and he identifies this group as one-accretion-down from the
larger bodies of Triton and Pluto/Charon.  Pluto/Charon, he thinks,
formed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material
into a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to
ideas about the formation of Earth's moon.  There is good evidence
from spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different
(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn't), which can be used as evidence
for the impact theory.

  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects
remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune's 
orbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members
of this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies
will be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane 
frost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons
by now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)
is that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,
and when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms
bright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going
to be very hard to see.

  I hope I haven't made any errors in the transcription; if you see
a howling mistake, it's undoubtedly mine, not his.

  By the way, he's one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby
mission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a
Titan 4 to send the probe on ""just about a rectilinear trajectory""
to Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He'd like
to use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs
MUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there
will be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million
for 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally
offered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced
to increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the
marketplace.

  I'm just telling you what he said.

to make *verbatim* copies for personal use. People can recuperate the
actual costs of printing (paper, copy center charges), but may not charge
anything for their time in making copies, or in any way realize a profit
from the use of this book. See the permissions notice in the book itself
for the precise terms.

Negotiations are currently underway with a Mormon publisher vis-a-vis the
printing and distribution of bound books. (Sorry, I'm out of the wire-bound
""first editions."") I will make another announcement about the availability
of printed copies once everything has been worked out.

FTP information: connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu, then ""cd

""The Easy-to-Read Book of Mormon"" is currently available in postscript and
RTF (rich text format). (ASCII, LaTeX, and other versions can be made
available; contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) You should be able to
print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an Apple
Laserwriter); let dba know if you have any difficulties. (The postscript in
the last release had problems on some printers; this time it should work
better.) RTF is a standard document interchange format that can be read in
by a number of word processors, including Microsoft Word for both the

Corel Draw will do it; version 2 onwards. If you have version 1 perhaps an
upgrade is in order.

Another alternative would be to use a different bureau that can take PostScript.

"   Analog SF magazine did an article on a similar subject quite a few
years ago.  The question was, if an alien spacecraft landed in
Washington, D.C., what was the proper organization to deal with it: The
State Department (alien ambassadors), the Defense Department (alien
invaders), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (illegal aliens),
the Department of the Interior (new non-human species), etc.  It was
very much a question of our perception of the aliens, not of anything
intrinsic in their nature.  The bibliography for the article cited a
philosophical paper (the name and author of which I sadly forget; I
believe the author was Italian) on what constitutes a legal and/or moral
person, i.e., a being entitled to the rights normally accorded to a
person.  The paper was quite interesting, as I recall.

   I think you'd have to be very careful here if the answer is yes.  The
human track record on helping those poor underpriveleged cultures (does
underpriveleged mean not having enough priveleges?) is terrible.  The
usual result is the destruction or radical reorganization of the
culture.  This may not always be wrong, but that's the way to bet.

"Ken:

Your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the Big
Boys if you're tackling Henry.  Allen Sherzer will doubtless chime in
on the subject of staggering operational costs, too.  Good luck, son.


Ahem.  The Russians are in the Free World now, or at least it would be
Politically Correct to contend so.


It will be tough to make DC-X succeed, and to turn it into an
operational orbital vehicle.  Doubtless it will fail to meet some of
the promised goals.  The reason people are so fond of it is that it's
the *only* chance we have now, or will have for a *long* time to come,
to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs.  

There is no Shuttle successor in funded development, NASP is dwindling
away, and ALS/NLS/Spacelifter sure as hell aren't gonna knock any
zeroes off that $2000-$3000 per pound cost.   Part of the blame for
this must be placed on a Shuttle program that consumes many annual
billions of the, er, Free World's available space cash.  As you will
no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come. (-:

DC-X is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping
development costs low and flying incremental ""X-plane"" hardware.
It's been, to my mind, incredibly successful already-- they've built a
complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks.  I would
have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s
America, never mind flying the thing, getting a successor funded, or
building the DC-Y.

I'm sure you know well that launch costs are THE basic problem for any
expansion of astronautics.  I don't see a realistic  prospect for
beating down those costs, for multi-ton payloads, anywhere else.  If
the DC flops, it'll be business as usual in space.  The Nineties and
the Double-Oughts will look just like the Seventies and Eighties, a
prospect too depressing to bear.

(Pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different
direction.  It doesn't lower cost-per-pound but it offers an orbital
launch for under ten megabucks.  It's creating its own market for
small payloads.)

I read the magazines and I've attended the last two IAFs. There are
plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems, some
of them as good as or better than SSTO.  There is no sign in today's
world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an
assembly line.

[...deleting some things I'm not going to prove tonight...]

Strawman.  Is anybody seriously proposing this?  References, please. 
The DC must be developed in the real-world funding climate, which
includes a NASA ferociously committed to continuing Shuttle
operations, as well as the ""bird in the hand"" argument your common
sense tells you.   If DC-Y flies at all, it flies alongside the
Shuttle, not instead of it.

Also, of course, DC-Y and its operational descendants will be useful
for a wide variety of jobs even if they are *not* man-rated.


If a DC-X successor can fly a 10,000-kg payload for $1M, or even $5M,
rather than the $40M it now costs, more people will be able to afford
more payloads... for the same money, you can fly several satellites
instead of one.  Big outfits can fly multi-satellite series.  Little
outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own, instead of
begging a ride.  This is just supply and demand.  You should be able
to convince *yourself* that point 4 will be true, assuming DC makes a
big difference in costs.  Do you have some reason to think not?",2

	As I don't know this book, I will use your heresay.


	It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning
of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn
from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming
scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide
that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations
drawn from them.

	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within
science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic
way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails.


	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the
tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge,
or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It
gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge
while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science
and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional
answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful
questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of
sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve
in contradiction.",0
"

Sounds like more of the same.  Gods were used to describe almost
everything in the past.  As we come to understand the underpinnings of
more and more, the less we credit to a god.  Now, the not-so-well
understood elements (at least by the author) includes quarks and tectonic
drift.  I guess that's better than describing the perceived patterns of
stars in the sky as heroes being immortalized by the gods.

Kinda sounds like old-earth creation--It seems that life did, indeed, evolve
from a common ancestor.  What caused that initial common ancestor?

Are we going to hear another debate on causeless events? ;-)

Well, no, during the original deployment mission the HST aperture door was
not opened until after the Shuttle had landed.  

I presume that during a re-boost mission HST would be berthed in the orbiter
with the orbiter bay doors shut; but still there would be lots of contamination
worries.  I understand that the EVA suits are one of the hardest things to 
keep clean.

But I still don't know where the idea is coming from that HST _NEEDS_ a
re-boost.  We have many problems but our orbit is the least of them.  There
is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in

Only if he doesn't spend more than a billion dollars doing it, since the
prize is not going to be scaled up to match the level of effort.  You can
spend a billion pretty quickly buying Titan launches.

What's more, if you buy Titans, the prize money is your entire return on
investment.  If you develop a new launch system, it has other uses, and
the prize is just the icing on the cake.

I doubt very much that a billion-dollar prize is going to show enough
return to justify the investment if you are constrained to use current
US launchers.  (There would surely be a buy-American clause in the rules
for such a prize, since it would pretty well have to be government-funded.)
You're going to *have* to invest your front money in building a new launch
system rather than pissing it away on existing ones.  Being there first is
of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it.

No, the thing is designed to be retrievable, in a pinch.  Indeed, this
dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays, since they had to be

to the array-flapping problems.

The retrieval problems are exactly as stated:  it would be costly, would
involve extensive downtime (and the worry of someone finding a reason not
to re-launch it), and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot

Mr. Hathaway's post is right on the money, if a little lengthy.  In short,
an orbiting billboard would be trash, in the same way that a billboard on
the Earth is trash.  Billboards make a place look trashy.  That is why there
are laws in many places prohibiting their use.  The light pollution
complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against
orbiting billboards because people don't feel morally justified to complain
on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky.

more like abstract entities, but a billboard in space would be like a beer

#
#In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live

#
#Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature
#(which has happened, it was even patented...!!!), does he then have the
#right to expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?

Dear Joakim, let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions,
but that by asking, you will find as many different explanations as there
are respondents.  As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,
me, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)
in the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,
an earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by
sight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things
to become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of
God's spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of
this earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer's plan, most followed
the Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer's aspirations (""I
will exalt my throne above the stars of God . . ."" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)
resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and
those who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who
became Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven
(""And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast
them to the earth . . ."" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).

To get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to
God and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),
we made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: ""Where wast thou
when I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars
sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?"" Job 38:4-7).  We
lost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the ""Veil of Forgetful-
ness,"" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.

You may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the
Bible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular
aspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.

#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so
#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,
#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?
#
#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd
as they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe
in the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They
will cry ""heresy"" and other accusations of ""perverting"" the doctrines of
the Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as
found in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)

As for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as
explained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea
Scroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not
least, modern-day revelation on the subject.

ROME REBORN:  THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE
presents some 200 of the Vatican Library's most precious
manuscripts, books, and maps--many of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of Greece and
Rome.  The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican
Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through
April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by
anonymous FTP indefinitely.

     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican
Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &
Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came
to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each
section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit
includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,
but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
omitted later in the planning process.

     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance
scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of
science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the
humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,
theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and
to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the
README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If
you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local
computer support person.  If you have questions or comments about
the CONTENT of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov
while if you have any questions or comments on the SYSTEM please

Well, we already suffer from street hoardings.  If you don't
watch TV, you are free of commercials there, but if you want
to go from A to B you cannot escape beer ads.


I think the right time to stop this proposal is now.

If this idea goes through, it's the thin end of the wedge.  Soon
companies will be doing larger, and more permanant, billboards in the
sky.  I wouldn't want a world a few decades from now when the sky
looks like Las Vegas.  That would _really_ make me sad.

Coca Cola company will want to paint the moon red and white.  (Well,
if not this moon, then a moon of Jupiter).  Microscum will want to
name a galaxy `Microscum Galaxy'.  Where do we draw the line?
Historically mankind is not very good at drawing fine lines.

I'm normally extremely enthusiastic about all forms of resource
allocation for space research; I think it's the most important
investment possible for mankind in the long run.  But this is not

There's a difference between believing in the existence of an entity,
and loving that entity. God _could_ show me directly that he exists,
and I'd still have a free choice about whether to love him or not. So
why doesn't he?

"OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
(for better or for worse).

I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
switching.

A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
even more...",1

[...stuff deleted...]

As many posters have said in as many posts lately, this is just
not true.  For to show no interest in the existence of god takes no
faith at all.  You make the presumption that the _knowledge_ of the 
_possibility_ of something is enough to require faith to render 
that possibilty of no interest.  It is a very different thing to say
that you don't believe something than it is to say that you don't
have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to 
think about.  It's not either or.  Sometimes is just something else
more interesting that occupies your mind.  

I agree that faith and dogma are inevitable, but not necessarily
applied to god and religion.  It takes both faith and dogma to
expect the sun to come up every morning, but there is overwhelming
reason every single day, day in and day out, for _everyone_ to put 
his faith and dogma there.  Not so with the christian religion.

Gregg, you haven't provided even a title of an article to support *your*
contention.


You also have no reason to believe it *is* an anti-Islamic slander job, apart
from your own prejudices.


Why, yes.  What's a mere report in The Times stating that BCCI followed
Islamic banking rules?  Gregg *knows* Islam is good, and he *knows* BCCI were
bad, therefore BCCI *cannot* have been Islamic.  Anyone who says otherwise is
obviously spreading slanderous propaganda.


I see.  If someone wants to provide references to articles you agree with,
you will also respond with references to articles you agree with?  Mmm, yes,
that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate.  Doubtless that's how

"BIOLOGICAL ALCHEMY
                          
                        ( ANOTHER Form of COLD FUSION )

               ( ALTERNATIVE Heavy Element Creation in Universe ) 

               A very simple experiment can demonstrate (PROVE) the 
          FACT of ""BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS"" (reactions like Mg + O 
          --> Ca, Si + C --> Ca, K + H --> Ca, N2 --> CO, etc.), as 
          described in the BOOK ""Biological Transmutations"" by Louis 
          Kervran, [1972 Edition is BEST.], and in Chapter 17 of the 
          book ""THE SECRET LIFE OF PLANTS"" by Peter Tompkins and 
          Christopher Bird, 1973: 

               (1) Obtain a good sample of plant seeds, all of the same 
                   kind.  [Some kinds might work better that others.]

               (2) Divide the sample into two groups of equal weight 
                   and number.

               (3) Sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper 
                   for three or four weeks.

               (4) Separately incinerate both groups.

               (5) Weigh the residue from each group.  [The residue of 
                   the sprouted group will usually weigh at least 
                   SEVERAL PERCENT MORE than the other group.]

               (6) Analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for 
                   mineral content.  [Some of the mineral atoms of the 
                   sprouted group have been TRANSMUTED into heavier 
                   mineral elements by FUSING with atoms of oxygen, 
                   hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc..]

          
               BIOLOGICAL TRANSMUTATIONS occur ROUTINELY, even in our 
          own bodies. 
          
               Ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with 
          carbon, such as ""horsetail"" extract, or radishes) can SPEED 
          HEALING OF BROKEN BONES via the reaction Si + C --> Ca, (much 
          faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).  
          
               Some MINERAL DEPOSITS in the ground are formed by micro-
          organisms FUSING together atoms of silicon, carbon, nitrogen, 
          oxygen, hydrogen, etc.. 
          
               The two reactions Si + C <--> Ca, by micro-organisms, 
          cause ""STONE SICKNESS"" in statues, building bricks, etc..  
          
               The reaction N2 --> CO, catalysed by very hot iron, 
          creates a CARBON-MONOXIDE POISON HAZARD for welder operators 
          and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones). 
          
               Some bacteria can even NEUTRALIZE RADIOACTIVITY! 
          

               ALL OF THESE THINGS AND MORE HAPPEN, IN SPITE OF the 
          currently accepted ""laws"" of physics, (including the law 
          which says that atomic fusion requires EXTREMELY HIGH

Good point.  If you haven't read ""The True Believer"" by Eric Hoffer, do
so at your first opportunity.  I don't know why Hoffer is out of style
now, but ""The True Believer"" is still the best explanation of nutball
behavior ever written.",3

Interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The ""large""
grains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with
fair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the
thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating
efficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long
wavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate
the energy they have absorbed.

Moreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100
microns.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer
wavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In
the extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable
by any conceivable observation.

Worse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a
population of ""small"" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50
atoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to
temperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool
quickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_
the characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small
population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed
""average"" temperature.

A model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has
three components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal
dust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust
(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At
the ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are
respectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly
doubled in the ecliptic plane.

To find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution
factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then
take the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from
Allen's number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent
to 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work
could do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a
dilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be
cooked if that were the case.  In any event, the energy density of
starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave
background, and I believe that to be correct.)

                         Dilution   Temp.   DT^4
Microwave background         1        2.7     53
Galactic dust              2E-5      25        8
Zodiacal dust (emission)   6E-8     280      369
Zodiacal dust (scattering) 3E-13   5500      275
Starlight                  1E-13   5500       92
                                           -----
                                             797

The fourth root of 797 is 5.3 K.  Outside the Solar system, the
result would be 3.5 K.  

I find these results surprising, especially the importance of
Zodiacal dust, but I don't see any serious mistakes.

Some people might think it takes faith to be an atheist... but faith in
what?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that the Great Invisible Pink
Unicorn does not exist?  Does it take some kind of faith to say that Santa
Claus does not exist?  If it does (and it may for some people I suppose) it
certainly isn't as big a leap of faith to say that these things (and god)
DO exist.  (I suppose it depends on your notion and definition of ""faith"".)

Besides... not believing in a god means one doesn't have to deal with all
of the extra baggage that comes with it!  This leaves a person feeling
wonderfully free, especially after beaten over the head with it for years!
I agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer
for many people and for that reason I think it's important.  However,
trying to force a psychological fantasy (I don't mean that in a bad way,
but that's what it really is) on someone else who isn't interested is
extremely rude.  What if I still believed in Santa Claus and said that my
belief in Santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better
person, allowing me to live without guilt, etc...) and then tried to get
you to believe in Santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me?  You'd call
the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone.

"As per various threads on science and creationism, I've started dabbling into a
book called Christianity and the Nature of Science by JP Moreland.  A question
that I had come from one of his comments.  He stated that God is not 
necessarily a religious term, but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories, without being a proven scientific 
fact.  I think I got his point -- I can quote the section if I'm being vague. 
The examples he gave were quarks and continental plates.  Are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?

My apologies if this is a re-post - I submitted it on Friday, but 
got a message that my post might not have gone out.  Considering 
the confusing spitting contest over 'rights', (there are TOO 
inalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive 
of liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out 
of my site.    (I ain't saying that dark skies are included in these 
rights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) 



Anyway, here are my thoughts on this: 


I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

Faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
faith alone, which by its nature is without justification.  That
is what I mean by the word ``faith'': belief without justification, or
belief with arbitrary justification, or with emotional (irrational)
justification.

For example, when someone says that God exists, that they don't know
why they believe God exists, they can just feel it, that's faith.

Dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
on new information, or increased mental faculty.

Faith and dogma are irrational.  The faith and dogma part of any religion
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.  I claim that
faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion.  If that
makes (the much overused in this context) Buddism a philosophy rather
than a religion, I can live with that.  Science is not a religion,
because there is no faith nor dogma.

Have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists?  If a philosopher
is not an atheist, s/he tends to be called a theologian.

A Christian tends to consider Christianity sacred.  Christianity is
a special set of beliefs, sanctioned by God himself, and therefore,
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence
of That Being Who Makes No Mistakes.  Faith comes into play.  Dogma
comes into play.  ``The lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.
Sure, interpretations of what ``God said'' are changed to satisfy the
needs of society, but when God says something, that's it.  It was said,
and that's that.  Since God said it, it is unflawed, even if the
interpretations are flawed.

Science, (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast, has a
BUILT IN defence against faith and dogma.
A scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time, AND,
*AND*, ****AND***, a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way.  The goal is to keep improving
the beliefs.  The goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect
the best information currently available.  That's the only rational
thing to do.  That's good philosophy.

Can you see the difference?  Science views beliefs as being flawed,
and new information can be obtained to improve them.  (How many
scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding
of everything?  None---it would put them out of a job!)  Religion
views its beliefs as being perfect, and the interpretations of
those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which
conflicts with them.

It's easier for someone to kill a person when s/he doesn't require
a good rational justification of the killing.  I don't consider
``he's Jewish'', or ``he was born of Jewish parents'', or
``this document says he's Jewish'' to be good rational justification.

"----------------------   LightWave3D Mail-List   ----------------------

-- WHAT IS LightWave? --

LightWave3D is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the ""Toaster"" (from NewTek, Inc.) that operates on an
Amiga platform.  The LightWave software (LightWave=LightWave3D and
LightWave Modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo-realistic images for a variety of purposes.

-- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? --

This mailing list is for those interested in the LightWave software, how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them.  The list is for those who own the Toaster and
LightWave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package.  We hope to share information, tips, procedures and to bond as
a group.

-- WHAT ARE THE RULES? --

Since LightWave/Modeler are just a part of the Newtek Video Toaster
software, I'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the Toaster.  However, we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3D software, related tools and products.

You do NOT have to own a Toaster to join this list!

-- OK! HOW DO I JOIN? --

To become a member of the LightWave3D mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

subscribe lightwave-l your.name@your.site.domain

Or just ask to be signed up and I will sign you up to the list.  At this
point in time the process is manual but I hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon.  There shouldn't be too much of a
delay in joining.  Expect a ""welcome"" message within 5 days after you
send your request.  Then, expect the mail to start flowing in!

-- HOW DO I POST TO THE LIST? --

Contributing to the list is simple.  Just mail your articles to the
following address:

        lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

Your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list.  Your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list.  However, those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you.  So, if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid, your original article will be returned to you.  This
doesn't mean it hasn't been posted to the list.  In fact, just the
opposite is true. It means that your article WAS posted and that it
couldn't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

NOTE: I hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

-- HOW DO I QUIT THE LIST? --

Simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up:

        lightwave-request@bobsbox.rent.com

In the body of the message enter:

unsubscribe LightWave-l your.name@your.site.domain

I will remove your name from the list of members.  PLEASE, if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while, send a request to be removed from the
list!  If you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and I will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


-- WHAT ABOUT OLD ARTICLES? --

I am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox).  However, I can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space.  What we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list.  They can compress and store
them in archives on their system.  They can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

If there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large SCSI
hard drive to me for archival purposes. <grin>

I have setup a mail-based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles, the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the LightWave3D mailing list. For information on this service, please
send a mail message to:

        fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

The first command to the server must be ""HELP"" or ""USER name <passwd>"".

Use HELP to request a current copy of the helpfile.
Use USER name [passwd] to connect to the service.
Use ?    to get a short listing of all available commands.



-- NOW WHAT DO I DO? --

Well, sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information.  If you have
something to offer, please feel free to contribute that information to
the list.  Every little bit helps.  Questions are welcomed!  It makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. <grin>

If you have any questions or comments regarding the list, please contact
me at the address:

I ask:


Brian Kendig states:


Make up your mind. 


And we do not end perfect either.  We are never perfect.  Can you name
one person, young or old, past or present, that you deem perfect? 
Good luck.


Then you lie to yourself.  You do not know your shortcomings.  I have clearly
shown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible
and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its 
contents.


Because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.
And to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not
even know what the word ""Christ"" means.  Or which prophet used ""Christ"" to 
describe the ""Son of Man"". 


Yes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come
up with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said
and by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else's
interpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the
truth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as 
much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.

And remember, the Bible isn't a Guru's Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  
It doesn't take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The 
Bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed 
to people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it 
their open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they
want you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to
know.   They didn't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple
straight-forward language.


You have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the
road that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that
road doesn't look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One
that goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,
you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. 


I see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your
life.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing 
new in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are ""spouting off"" 
contradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must
be sad.


Bingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son
so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look
what God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have 
hope in his resurrection and know that life isn't for nothing, but has
glorious purpose.


Because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to
lie to yourself that he doesn't exist, for you ignore what has been said for 
thousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of 
Jesus's story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a 
bleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:

      ""For if Lazarus doesn't even listen to Moses and the Prophets,
       he won't even believe if a man rose from the dead.""


Arrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific
cases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect
in heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does
not expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not
as his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his
glorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  
You maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for
yourself.



I do understand what you said.   But that's is not what I feel went amiss here.

You missed the point.  Living a ""good life"" has no eternal consequences.
Once they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it 
is over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. 
It has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. 

But then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things 
is bad.  To you, it shouldn't matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is
all meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone
you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What's restraining you?
Life after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.


At which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.


So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa
Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to
believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I
can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.

You have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses
of Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and ""ignore"" the
reasons.  By definition, ""ignorance"". 

Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves
and flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human
history seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose 
blinks red?    

On the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really
a king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon
really kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?
Did Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did
Sennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a 
Caiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies
it.  It is NONFICTION.

Do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you
can't evaluate the context of Grimm's Fairy Tales apart from
that of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal
truthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or
is it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out
that it's not a fairy tale?


Get real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?  Do you have to go there
to be  assured that there really is such a place?  Given your 
irrationality, I take it you have never used a map in your life.

I see what you are getting at (or at least I think I do).  Correct me if
I am mistaken, but I *think* you are asking me if I still believe that we
should uphold all of the Laws pertaining to capital punishment for such
things as adultery, rape and other heinous crimes.  As you may recall,
Jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress
who was caught in the act and brought before Jesus.  And His reply, ""Let
he who is without sin cast the first stone.""  Jesus does not deny the
sentence that is to due for this violation of the Law.  What do you think
of this?


Agreed.  :)
 

Agreed also.  If one is to use the Bible as a reference, one must always be
open to different interpretations.  As a Christian, I have the Spirit of God
to verify what I believe in the Word.  If what the Spirit tells me is not
backed up in scripture then the spirit I am communicating with is not of
God.  After all, Jesus tells us to ""test the spirits"" to know for sure that
it is from God.


I obey what the Spirit of God tells me to do.  The Spirit will not violate
anything that is written in the Bible because that is the Word of God.  I do
not worship pastors, preachers, my wife, my mother or my father.  What they
tell me does not carry the weight of what God tells me to do and His commands
are rienforced in the Bible.
 

Eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting
God.  If you choose to jump off a cliff, you can hardly blame God for you 
going *splat* at the bottom.  He knows that if you choose to jump, that 
you will die but He will not prevent you from making that choice.  In fact,
He sent His Son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what
lies below.  To prove that point, Jesus took that plunge Himself but He being
God was able to rise up again.  I have seen the example of Christ and have 
chosen not to jump and I'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you'll 
go *splat*.

Would Mr. Hart please explain how one could get every nation on

Rome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle,
and she said Worship Cybele and you'll be saved. They did, they were.

Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son &
lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian,
from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st
as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome
in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.


Response:

Is there some relation between the name 'Cybele' and the phenemenon of the
'sibyl'?  Your paragraph above seems to indicate there might be.

My understanding is that Islam was founded on the remains of a goddess
cult or two.  Many Muslims would not like to hear that. ;>


You:

It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater),
could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black,
prob. IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was
supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into
a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was
an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and
castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women.
They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.

Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where
else?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I
forget by now...there's a book on that.)

Of course, that excepts that weird Russian / Romanian 18th cent. Xian cult
that did all kinds of self-castration too, I forget their name.


Response:

I'd love to get details or references on any of the above.  My own exploration
of this issue has only extended to a brief examination of the Zuni 'berdache'.
_The Zuni Man-Woman_, by Will Roscoe, University of New Mexico Press, 1991
probably has some interesting things to say about them.  I've yet to
procure it.

Any details or references on:

Ecstatic cults in Rome, India, Russia/Romania (Christian too?) which
exhibit any type of transsexualism or transvestitism, male OR female
(though I expect mostly the former will be found ;>).

Mathew, I agree.  This, it seems, is the crux of your whole position,

to fight Iran?  I agree.  And I agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
who did or do.  But we *did* sell arms to Hussein, and it's a done deal.
Now he invades Kuwait.  So do we just sit back and say, ""Well, we sold
him all those arms, I suppose he just wants to use them now.  Too bad
for Kuwait.""  No, unfortunately, sitting back and ""letting things be""
is not the way to correct a former mistake.  Destroying Hussein's
military potential as we did was the right move.  But I agree with
your statement, Reagan and Bush made a grave error in judgment to
sell arms to Hussein.  So it's really not the Gulf War you abhor
so much, it was the U.S.'s and the West's shortsightedness in selling
arms to Hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable, right?

If so, then I agree.

Oh, yes he did.  You may not agree with his premises, and what he proved may

Got it in one.  Similarly, a moral relativist will not judge one moral system
to be better than another in every possible circumstance.  This does not,
however, preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another
in a specific set of circumstances.  Nor does it preclude a set of moral
relativists from collectively judging a moral system, from some set of
circumstances which they all agree they are in.


Eh?  Could you explain this?  Which ""that statement"" are you talking about?


I still don't quite see what you're trying to say.  I assume by ""values"" you
mean moral values, yes?  In which case, what do you mean by ""real""?  What is
a ""real"" moral value, as opposed to an unreal one?


Sorry, but in what way is it an infinite regress?  It looks extremely finite
to me.


Sorry, but that's not so.  I can provide a justification for asserting that
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace.  I

faster than snails.  That justification won't hold in all possible frames of

""A note on gamma correction and images""

Author: Graeme W. Gill
        graeme@labtam.oz.au

Date: 93/5/16


""What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?""
--------------------------------------

Although it would be nice to think that ""an image is an image"",
there are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you've ever downloaded
images from BBS or the net, you've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some
look too light. ""Why is this ?"" you may ask. This, is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

Why do we need gamma correction at all ?
--------------------------------------

Gamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode
ray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene, then you have created a ""linear"" or un-gamma-corrected
image. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
Now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn't_ give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this:

Light_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma

So if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image
will look much too dark. To fix this up you have to ""gamma correct""
the image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT
will do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get
what you want. So you have to do this to your image:

gamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)

For most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

If that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?
-----------------------------------------------------

The problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
Also not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras
or video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them, and you are 
rarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those
images with a program that doesn't do gamma correction, then it will
look vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular CRT.

Whose fault is all this ?
-----------------------

It is really three things. One is all those display programs
out there that don't do gamma correction properly. Another is
that most image formats don't specify a standard gamma, or
don't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
The third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about, and create a lot of images with varying
gamma's.

At least two file formats do the right thing.
The Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).

Some image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.

[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the
appropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity
in the HSV controls doesn't do the right thing, as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends
to give a tint to the image. ]

How can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using
dithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a
bit.)

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

If your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be
around 2.2 

[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the
-dispgamma flag, and once you've got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA
environment variable in your .profile]

How do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?
-------------------------------------------------

This is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

If your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.

If your viewer doesn't do gamma correction, then linear images will
look too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.

Why Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing
-----------------------------------------------------

One of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
Video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. This is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. This means images 
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),
if they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

If some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).",1

Oh, good: word games.  If you let the aggressor pick the words,
there's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action.

Very noble and patriotic.  I'm sure the fine young Americans who
carpet-bombed Iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon,
destroyed Iraq's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the

RIght now the HST sevicing mission is listed as 11 days.  before
it was listed as 9 days.  they just kicked up the number of spacewalks
to 5,  after simulations indicated  that it was not do-able in 4.  

After all the space walking,  they are going to  re-boost the HST's
orbit.  I think right now  it's sitting  at 180 miles up,
they would like  220.  I don't know the exact orbit numbers.
I know when HST was first flown, it was placed in the Highest
possible Shuttle orbit. 

Now the shuttle can cary a thing called the EDO pallet, or extended
duration orbiter pallet.  It's mostly  LOX/LH for the fuel cells
and RCS gear,  plus more O2  and canisters for the life support
re-breathers.  maybe more nitrogen too.

THe limit on space-walking is a function of suit supplies (MASS)
and Orbiter Duration.   

In order to perform the re-boost of the HST, the OMS engines
will be fired for a long period.  Now the shuttle is a heavy
thing.  THe HST isn't light either.  THe amount of OMS fuel
needed to fly both up is substantial.   a small booster
carried up and used to boost HST on it's own will weigh significantly
less then the OMS fuel required to Boost  both HST and SHUttle,
for a given orbital change.  

From what i understand,  the mass margins on the HST missions are
tight enough they can't even carry extra Suits or MMU's.

Now if they used a small tug,  I would bet,  just a wild guess,
that the savings on amss margin  would allow carrying the
EDO pallet,  extra suits,  more consumables,  parts for the
flaky FGS sensor,  parts for the balky solar  electronics,

and still enough for a double magnum of champagne.

or the HST could even get placed into  some sort of medium orbit.
The reason they want a high orbit, is less antenna pointing,
and longer drag life.

Since this was posted on comp.ai, I assume there is an AI angle to this.  Hacking is
what AI students do when they're really supposed to be doing something else, e.g.
thesis research & write up, getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly,
etc.  No-one gets much glory for hacking, and no-one gets any money out of it.
Producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time & resources that
not many people can, or want to, afford - particularly during a recession.

In addition, over the last 10 years, I think there has been a de-emphasis on producing
running programs in AI research, and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problem-solving.  Students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
At a conference a year or two ago, Johann de Kleer suggested that everyone should
'Get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas -
and I have to say I'm inclined to agree.

Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood
etc.
Now you are saying:


If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a *lot* easier.

----------------


Eh? Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is
not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this
paragraph defeats me.


Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.

But this statement contradicts what you said earlier: 


---------------



No I don't think so actually. 

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual
colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?


Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!


I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.


???
What are you saying
???


Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are
saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem!!



Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.


Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy, however.


Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.



As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what
the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.


Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?


Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.


Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)

Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets
you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the
human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for. It makes no false claims.


If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So 
far, you have not done so.


Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.


I think this is a bit of an exageration.

What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in
the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else
had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...


you bet


Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly
thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. Go think
some more.

This was all badly reported in the news.  There is no evidence that

Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that
it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.

The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful
options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on
all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared
to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --
again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored
by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also
note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that
none of the FAX formats are really useful.

What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,
e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have
provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses
bytes rather than pixels.

But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register
proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.
This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably
read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.",1

No quarrel here.  The BIG BANG theory is always apt at appropriation

I certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government's
case since it makes no claims of illegal action.  Therefore the federal
judge had reason to seal it.  But I am reminded of Senator Frank Church's

There is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of
free people.

the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and

about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph), and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid Moromn

   OK, with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with QuickTime,
   the effects of scaling and so on, I thought I'd do some more tests.

   First of all, I felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
   realistic. The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).
   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results
   (for better or for worse).

   I pulled out a copy of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" that I had recorded off TV
   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there's a sequence where
   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized
   a portion of about 30 seconds' duration, zooming in on the rotating space
   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only
   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.

   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot
   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then
   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,
   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled
   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default
   ""2.00"" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten
   frames.

   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same ""Raw Speed Test"" program I used
   for the results I'd been reporting earlier.

   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

   That's right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short
   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard
   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate
   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk
   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240
   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who
   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in
   action, not 1.5. I'd try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don't think it's
   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...

   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.

   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with
   ""preferred"" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played
   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime's normal synchronized playback).
   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn't work too well: the playback was
   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with
   ease. I can't believe that QuickTime's synchronization code would add this
   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system's task
   switching.

   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn't see
   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight
   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.

   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also
   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance
   even more...

I'm afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that
can significantly affect QuickTime's playback speed that you may want to take
into account:

(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16
bit, but other depths are (of course) possible).

(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for ""double size"" scaling, other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder).

(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I'm not sure about Premiere).

Any combination of those can radically alter playback performance.  Image size
is, of course, another biggie.  Giving the movie player lots of RAM can also
make a real difference.

Forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...

#
#This is still contradictory. It reduces to
#
#  (1): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].
#
#  (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for
#       [bug] (meaning that it doesn't lend more weight to one than to the
#       other)
#
#  (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence
#       can exist for [bug].
#
#But (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). When you say (paraphrased)
#in (2) that this is not ""evidence for [benefactor]"", for example, what you
#mean is that it's no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].

Yes, that's what I mean.

#In (3), however, you've shifted the meaning of ""evidence for [benefactor]""
#so that it now means `absolute' ""evidence for [benefactor]"" rather than
#`relative' ""evidence for [benefactor]"" w.r.t. [bug].

Not really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I
think this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,
in my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates
to theism making predictions (prayer, your 'Rapture' example), I don't
buy your use of Occam's razor in all cases where A=0.

In my example, one couldn't dismiss
[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary
to explain the dosh.  I brought up the 'one-by-one dismissal' process to
show that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you're saying in this
post, it seems you agree, and we're talking at cross-purposes.

#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).
#
#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:
#
#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1
#
#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it's either the benefactor *or* a bug
#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then
#
#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)
#
#so
#
#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1
#
#but (3) implies that
#
#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.

No, this isn't what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with
necessarily no new observation (we've already seen the dosh) to change
those estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that
it would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that's
precisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are
one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of
hypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise 
would _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or
retained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   
Alternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds
that the answer can't be known, or that the notional probability estimates
are effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).

#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation

#
#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don't ""throw out"" any of
#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.

Some people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.
My sole point was that they aren't.

#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x

#
#> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.
#
#You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.

I was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.

#
#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which
#can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this
#thread.

Then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If
the razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which
means that you're assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we've already
established that it's not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over
all i.

#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or

#
#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous
#occasions. You wouldn't be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?
#Although that doesn't, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case
#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).
#
#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is
#""evidence against"" an hypothesis, that doesn't imply that observation of
#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the
#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it's still
#evidence against H.

No, I got that.  I'm talking about the case when A=0.  You're clearly
correct when A!=0.   And I'm not constructing a strawman (though it's
certainly possible that I've misunderstood what you're saying).  However,
by any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,
and when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting
to be an inductive proof that gods either don't exist, or are unnecessary
to explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this
(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain
a fallacy upon close examination.  If that's not what you're saying, then
please put me straight.",0

I read it when it first came out, and the controversy broke. Put my name
on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really
offensive, none of my money would find its way to the author or
publisher), and read it, ""cover to cover"" (to use a phrase that seems
popular here right now).

And I *liked* it. The writing style was a little hard to get used to, but
it was well worth the effort. Coming from a similar background (Rushdie
grew up in Bombay in a muslim family, and moved to England; I grew up in
New Delhi), it made a strong impression on me.  (And he used many of the
strange constructions of Indian English: the ""yaar"" at the end of a
sentence, ""Butbutbut,"" the occasional hindi phrase, etc.)

At the time I still ""sorta-kinda"" thought of myself as a muslim, and I
couldn't see what the flap was all about. It seemed clear to me that this
was allegory.  It was clear that he described some local prostitutes who
took on the names and personae of Muhammed's wives, and had not (as my
grandfather thundered) implied that Muhammed's wives were prostitutes; in
short, every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to
have missed the point completely.  (And I won't mention the fact that the
most militant of them had never even seen the book. Oops, I just did!)

Perhaps in a deep sense, the book is insulting to Islam, because it
exposes the silliness of revealed religion - why does an omnipotent deity
need an agent? She can come directly to me, can't she? How do we know that
Muhammed didn't just go out into the desert and smoke something? And how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the Quran to didn't screw up, or
put in their own little verses? And why can Muhammed marry more than four
women, when no other muslim is allowed to? (Although I think the biggest
insult to Islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book, sight unseen, on the say-so of some ""holy"" guy. Not to
mention murder the author.)


I had much the same response when I tried to talk about the book. A really
silly argument - after all, how many of these same people have read ""Mein
Kampf?"" It just made me wonder - what are they afraid of? Why don't they
just read the book and decide for themselves?

Maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book, and the absence of
protest from the ""liberal"" muslims to Khomeini's fatwa outrage, was the
final push I needed into atheism!

[ Deletia; in case anybody hadn't noticed, Frank and I are debating
  ""objective morality"", and seemingly hitting semantics. ]


      It may be that, being a non-native English-speaker, I've
misunderstood your usage of ""objective"", and tried to debate something
you don't assert; my apologies. I'm at a loss to imagine what you really
do mean, though.


      Wrong point. The age of the universe has no direct effect on
humanity's sticking power, in the way the moral system of a society can
have.

      I'm saying the Universe has a ""real age"", because I see evidence
for it; cosmology, astronomy and so on. I say this age is independent of
people's opinions of it, because I know different people have a lot of
different opinions in the matter, yet empirical tests consistently seem
to give roughly the same results.


      I can't see how it does that. Put a creationist to the task of
performing the tests and calculations, see to it (s)he makes no blatant
errors in measuring or calculating, and the result of the test will be
the same.


      Because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their
opinion. If those tests were just my opinion, then their own tests
(which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine, even if we
conducted said tests in identical manner, no? They don't, which I take
as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.


      Map the activity of nerves and neural activity, if you mean
physical pain. You have a sharp point, I'll give you that; but you still
haven't given me a way to quantify morality.


      We agree. Hypotheses, however, can change; I hold that there is no
""ultimate hypothesis of morality"" towards which these changes could
gravitate, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable,
producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.


      ""Better"" and ""worse"" are (almost?) always defined in the context
of a moral system. Your prediction will _always_ be correct, *within*
*that* *moral* *system*. What you need now is an objective definition of
""good"" and ""bad""; I wish you luck.


      Isn't that what _you're_ doing, when assuming an ""objectively
real"" morality? Besides, what _exactly_ is provably wrong with my
statement?


      Claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive
claim? Besides, I think I _can_ lend some credence to my claim; ponder
different individuals, both fully functional as human beings and members
of society, but yet with wildly different moral codes. If morality was
""objective"", at least one should be way off base, but yet hir
'incorrect' morality seems to function fine. How come?

      As for producing these individuals, it might be easiest to pick
them from different societies; say, an islamic one and some polynesian
matrilineal system, for example (if such still exist).

      One thing is ""good"" under some circumstances, because we wish to
achieve some goal, for some reason. Other times we wish to do something
else, and that thing is no longer so clearly ""good"" at all.

      Some things are hard to make ""good"", because we'd seldom if ever
wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. Still,
the Aztecs were doing fine until the Spaniards wiped them out.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.

/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

I think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that
God definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that
the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a
theist. 


You're missing something here.  There are people who convert from
non-theism to theism after being brought up in a non-theist household.  (I
don't have any statistics as to how many though.  That would be an
interesting thing to know.)  I think that religion is a crutch.  People are
naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable.  People don't want
to believe that when they die, they are dead, finished.  That there is
nothing else after that.  And so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.
Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things
science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of
security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.
That they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions.  This
has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
belief system for what it gains them.  This is why I think it's kind of
useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism.  They are happy with
their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
the harsh reality that they are running from).

Anyway, I'm getting kind of carried away here.  But my point is that theism
doesn't have to be ingrained into a child's mindset for that person to grow
up as a theist (although this happens far too often).  Theism is designed
to have its own attractions.

"The LAW of RETRIBUTION
          
               Violent crime, racism, bigotry, domestic abuse, rape, 
          police brutality and oppression, human rights violations, 
          etc., ETC., continue to get worse and worse in spite of more 
          and more man-made laws on all levels from local ordinances to 
          international law. 
          
               The man-made laws are NOT working. 

               ""WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS FAILURE TO COMMUNICATE!""  
          Perpetrators remain IGNORANT of The LAW--a universal, cosmic, 
          and Spiritual Law--The ""LAW of RETRIBUTION"" or ""KARMA"": 
          
               ""Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a 
          man soweth, that shall he also reap.""  Galatians 6:7, KJV. 
    
               ""He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity; 
          he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.  
          Here is the patience and faith of the saints.""  Revelation 
          13:10, KJV. 
    
               ""What goes around comes around.""

               This LAW of the Universe is just as real as the physical 
          law that for every action there is an equal and opposite 
          REaction. 
    
               It is the ENFORCEMENT, the TEETH, behind The ""GOLDEN 
          RULE"": ""Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."" 

               ALL perpetrators in the present will become VICTIMS in 
          the future, most likely in a FUTURE INCARNATION.  Most 
          victims in the present were PERPETRATORS in the past, usually 
          during a PREVIOUS LIFE. 
          
               What is needed is a MASSIVE WORLDWIDE PROGRAM of 
          EDUCATION to teach ALL present and potential perpetrators, in 
          a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence), 
          that what they do to others WILL BE DONE TO THEM, in this 
          life or the next. 
          
               Anyone who doubts the FACT of REINCARNATION, and the 
          related ""LAW of Retribution"", should read books such as ""HERE 
          AND HEREAFTER"", by Ruth Montgomery, which describes several 
          kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation, including 
          HYPNOTIC REGRESSION to past lives [about 50% accurate; the 
          subconscious mind can sometimes make things up, especially 
          with a bad hypnotist], SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by 
          young children, some of whom can identify their most recent 
          previous relatives, homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL 
          of past life experiences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off 
          land while traveling there for the first time on vacation), 
          the psychic readings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN 
          SUPPORTING STATEMENTS FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including 
          Matthew 17:11-13 (John the Baptist was the REINCARNATION of 
          Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How can a person POSSIBLY sin before 
          he is born, unless he LIVED BEFORE?!). 
          
               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in their PRESENT 
          life, because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION. 

               People would behave much better toward each other if 
          they knew that their actions in the present will SURELY be 
          reaped by them in the future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION!

Well, I dived in feet first and reverse engineered the .PRJ file as much
as I needed to - extracted the mapping icon information - which is
when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs. I need
a mapping icon per applied texture.  I want to use a special purpose
graphics computer for rendering the 3DS models and it requires a texture
rule/plane to be specified in 3Space, i.e. position/orientation of the
mapping rule.  Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS to apply
textures to ALL objects/faces, it renders (no pun intended) 3DS totally
unsuitable for my needs.

Anyone got a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a

That's a fallacy, and it is not the first time it is pointed out.
For one, you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. Unlike
a football. Further, you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. The analogy
does not hold.
 
One can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football,
while YOU have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals YOU have to give.
 
Further, the above is evidence, not proof. Proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

Cute characterization Bill; however, there is no inconsistency between 
the two statements.  Even if one believes that religion is ""primitive, 
simple-minded and unscientific, anti-intellectual and childish"", one
can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of
complexity to the explanation.  The ideas themselves don't have to be
complex before being excised by Occam's Razor, they only have to add 
unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.


I think the non-essential part of an explanatory system is one that
adds no predictive capability to the system.

You may want to put Hubble back in the payload bay for a reboost,
and you don't want to clip off the panels each time.

For the Gamma-Ray Observatory, one of the design requirements was that
there be no stored-energy mecahnisms (springs, explosive squibs, gas shocks,
etc.) used for deployment.  This was partially so that everything could
be reeled back in to put it back in the payload bay, and partially for
safety considerations.  (I've heard that the wings on a cruise missile
would cut you in half if you were standing in their swath when they opened.)

Back when the shuttle would be going up every other day with a cost to
orbit of $3.95 per pound :-), everybody designed things for easy servicing.

"The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,
but there are a number of items not seen here yet.....

Redesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,
based on information provided by NASA headquarters.

The station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the
Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The
day-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics
covered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for
the space station; science, technology and engineering research; the
assessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management
options and operations concepts also were held.

The Design Teams then presented the three options under study:

¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest
said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has
identified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended
and permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed
to achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable
capability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified
Freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing
systems such as the so-called ""Bus-1 spacecraft,"" the orbiter and Spacelab.

The Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom
photo voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab
missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.

Human Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.
Common Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking
ports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter
docked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different
operation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.

¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option
B activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,
from initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent
Human Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent
Human Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the
baseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking
system, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data
Management System.

Initial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree
inclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration
orbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic
arrays providing 18.75 kW of power.

Human-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss
segments and the U.S. lab.

Permanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two
orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.

Two Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other
section of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and
propulsion systems.

The freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete
state with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,
a third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete
the Permanent Human Capability with International stage.

Griffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware
would not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived
option.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including
program management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and
operations costs, he said.

¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,
the Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid
rocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle
main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch
and jettisoned after ET separation.

The module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000
cubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 ""decks"" connected by a
centralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various
places on the circumference of the module to place the international
modules, and other elements.  This ""can"" would have two fixed photo voltaic
arrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial
attitude.

In his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O'Connor
said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so
that detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the
Redesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.

Russian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space
experts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members
of the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space
Agency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. 
Others on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,
the Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team
briefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking
systems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the
Soyuz TM spacecraft.

The Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities
of the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian
capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will
be available to the SRT through May 5.

Management and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT
subgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to
develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a
foundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various
management options have been developed including:

¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of
command.

¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate
Administrator.

¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located
hand-picked program office.

¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an
element of the current program.

¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and
geographical distribution maintained but streamlined.

The Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the
Operations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had
already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its
preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.

As part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency
experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of
assembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing
and ground operations.

What's in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a
comprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday
and Tuesday at which point the design will be ""frozen"" to begin the
detailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing
for the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to
be held May 3.

Dr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the
Station Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O'Connor will take over the
activities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant
deputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve
as a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to
consult with the SRT. Mr Goldin accepted the resignation so that a request
from Dr. Shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated.

Key Milestones -- The key dates for the SRT as they are currently being
carried on the schedule are:

April 26
Design Freeze on Options for Costing

April 27
Design Support Team Present Selected Options to SRT

May 3
Status report to Redesign Advisory Committee

May 15
Interim report by Redesign Advisory Committee

June 7

Apart from the fact that you get G in the pull-out, not the dive, that
figure is about right for sustained G, no protection.
The duration of G, it's rate of onset, body position and support aids are
all critical parts of the equation. I remember one note about instrumented
gridiron players recording peaks about 200G. Stapp, the aviation doctor,
either by accident or design, took a short-period 80G in a rocket-sled
decelleration, eye-balls-out against a standard (1950's) harness. It had
to be short, calculate the stopping time, even from 500 - 600mph at that
G. A bang-seat can get up to about 60 G, and you'd better be sitting
straight. Find the book by Martin-Bakers human guinea pig to hear how bad
it can get if the rate of onset is too high. A reclining position and a
good G-suit can keep a pilot functioning at around 12G.

A flotation tank should be a good bet, since you can treat the body as a
fluid, and high-pressure situations are not new. Anyone have any figures?",2

                      Genoa Presents High Performance 
                        Video Graphics Accelerator

        SAN JOSE, Calif USA -- Genoa Systems Corporation announces 
WINDOWSVGA 24,  a True Color 24-bit graphics accelerator card that 
delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the 
competition.  Plus it offers a full range of resolutions, high 
refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.  
The card is available in both 16-bit ISA bus and 32-bit VESA Local 
bus versions (models 8500 AND 8500VL).
        With 1MB DRAM on board, the WINDOWSVGA 24 card offers 
maximum resolution up to 1,280 x 1,024 and supports a refresh rate 
of 72Hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1,024 x 768 
non-interlaced. Both models provide performance many times greater 
than standard SVGA boards, yet conform to all current video 
standards.
        WINDOWSVGA 24 features Genoa's FlickerFree(tm) technology, 
which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more 
comfortable.  the cards also come with Safescan(tm), a utility 
developed by Genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen 
and thereby provide 100-percent screen use for overscanning monitors.
        WINDOWSVGA model 8500VL takes full advantage of the speed 
offered by the new VESA Local bus technology.  Most VL bus cards 
will only handle data transfers up to 33MHz, but the 8500VL will 
transfer data at the full speed of the CPU, up to 50MHz.  Genoa is 
also offering this card in the ""TurboBahn"" combination packaged 
with their TURBOEXPRESS 486VL motherboard.
        Built around the Cirrus Logic GD-5426 GUI accelerator, 
WINDOWSVGA 24 offers the user an exceptional price/performance 
value.  Genoa's advanced proprietary drivers act to ""turbocharge"" 
the chip, thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with 
power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced 
chip cards.  The Genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and 
reliability for such programs as Windows, AutoCAD, AutoShade, 3D 
Studio, OS/2, OrCAD and more.  Driver updates and product bulletins 
are available on Genoa's BBS at (408) 943-1231.
        Genoa Systems manufactures and markets an extensive line of 
graphics adapters, motherboards, audio and multimedia cards for 
IBM-compatible personal computers.  All products come with a two 
year limited warranty on parts and labor.  Genoa products are 
currently distributed worldwide through authorized distributors,

I use it to refer to those Christians who take a more
conservative-literalist approach to the Bible, as distinct from
""liberals"".


I would use the word ""Christian"" (unqualified) to describe someone to
whom the above definition applied.  BTW, it applies to me.

[deletia: Joe Gaut indicates his interest in the BD disaster is from a
civil liberties issue, not an attempt to justify Koresh's beliefs
and/or practices.]

I agree with Joe about this: if some group wants to believe in
whatever god or Invisible Pink Unicorns and go off and live together
and have group sex, or no sex, or sex only for the leaders (but NOT
with children), then, as much as I might believe them to be misguided,
I think they should have the legal right.  And I hope the
investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any
*legitimate* reason for going after Koresh in the first place (before
moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).

[Joe goes on to dispute the child-abuse allegations.  I'll
(provisionally) accept this, unless someone has evidence to support
the allegations?]

Actually I wasn't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse, but about
the reports that he had sex with, and fathered children by, several
women in the cult.  I agree this is not a legal matter - consenting
adults and all that - but Stephen Tice seems to be defending Koresh's
beliefs and practices from specifically *Christian* perspective, not a
civil liberties perspective.  

I think my question is not really aimed at Joe (and possibly not at
Ray Cote either, who seems to also be taking the political angle), but
at Stephen Tice.

This is a whole different situation.  If aliens were able to get here prior
to us being able to get there, one might conclude that they would be more advanced
and therefore ""more intelegent"" that we are.  However if we get somewhere where there
is life, chances are we wont be able to communicate with them.  So we will have
no clue as to weather they are ""intelegent"" or not.


That's a good point, I hadn't thought of it that way.  My question however was
more along the lines of... Every year the US spends millions of tax dollars
and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign
countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night.
Would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn't resolved
these issues on our own?


But... Your comment brings up another good question.  Over the years we have decided
that certain cultures need improvements.  The native americans is a good example.  Prior
to our attempt to civilize them, the native american culture had very little crime, no
homelessnes, no poverty.  Then the europeans came along and now they have those and
more.  If we encounter life elsewhere, do we tell them they have to live in houses, farm
the land and go to church on sunday?

Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By 
the time they could make the Earth's sky look like Las Vegas, 
the people could afford to go backpacking on the Moon. Round
trip costs for 500 kg to the Moon would be about the same as
5000 kg in a Low Earth ""advertising"" orbit: Very roughly the
same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were
to become common place, that would have to be a very low price...

The night sky on a Lunar backpacking trip would still be very 
pristine... 

There's always been a problem of having to get 
away from civilization before you can really find ""natural""
scenery. 100 years ago, this usually didn't take a trip
of over 5 miles. Today, most people would have to go 100 miles
or more. If we ever get to the point where we have billboards
on orbit, that essentially means that no place on Earth is still
""wild."" While that may or may not be a good thing, the orbital
billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of 
growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will
not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_
the stars...

 
An ad on a moon of Jupiter would be rather pointless, since you need
a telescope to see them. However, I'd love to see them get all
the publicity they could from underwritting the ""Coca Cola Io
Orbital Mapping Probe.""  


They already can, to some extent: The IAU allows names derived from
sponsors or patrons of scientific research. If Microscum donates
money to a university astronomy program, one of the galactic

"Welcome to the Peace Run

                     You're invited to join in
                     a Global Relay Run... and
                     help light the Way.



                     ----  Why the Peace Run  ----

There's a new spirit in the Nineties: a spirit of oneness, a growing
belief in the possibility of true global peace.

The goal of the Sri Chinmoy Oneness-Home Peace Run is simple: to
bring this spirit forward in a concrete way, to transform it into
a reality in their own lives.

Every other year, thousands of men, women and children from more
than 70 nations - passing a flaming Peace Torch from hand to hand -
join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe.
Transcending political and cultural boundaries, they go from
nation to nation - across mountains, jungles and deserts - carrying
the message of brotherhood to all humankind.

Each person who holds or runs with the Peace Torch lights a path
for those who follow. Each time the Peace Torch changes hands, the
flame of oneness burns a little brighter - until one day it will
shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.


		    ----  Making History  ----

The three Peace Runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break-
throughs: in the Middle East, a landmark run crossed the Egyptian-
Israeli border; in Europe, a precedent-setting run linked Eastern
and Western Europe with Russia; in the United States, Mexico and
Canada, entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace;
and in Poland, the Peace Torch was blessed by Pope John Paul II.


		 ----  Speaking as One: World  ----
             ----  Leaders, Celebrities - and You  ----

The Peace Run has won the support of leaders the world over -
Presidents, Prime Ministers, religious leaders, sports figures and
entertainment personalities.

Its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper
reports, magazine articles and radio and TV broadcasts, including
specials on PBS, MTV and NBC's Today Show.

reconciliation. The world must know that God wants us to live
amicably as brothers and sisters, members of one family, the human
family, God's family.""  - Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
			  Nobel Peace Prize Winner


		   ----  How It All Works  ----

Peace Run 1993 started with a five-borrough relay in New York
City on Saturday April 17, converging at various points to lead
up to the opening ceremony outside the United Nations Dag
Hammarskjold Building. There, runners from around the world
were gathered for the fourth lighting of the Peace Torch.

From there, Peace Torches are now being transported to over
seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or
cross-country relay runs including the United States, Canada,
Japan, Australia, Russia and Eastern and Western Europe. Smaller
runs will take place in the Philippines, Mexico, Israel, South
America, Egypt and elsewhere in Africa. Distance to be covered:
31,000 miles.

the minds of those who support, participate in, witness, or hear
about the event.""  - Carl Lewis,
                     Six-Time Olympic Gold Medalist


                  ----  Who's Behind It  ----

The Peace Run is sponsored by the Sri Chinmoy Marathon Team, an
international running organization that believes sports can be a
powerful instrument for promoting world peace. Each year the Team
puts on hundreds of athletic events, including several world-class
ultramarathons, marathons and triathlons, in dozens of countries.

The Peace Run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador
Sri Chinmoy, who has written and lectured extensively on peace,
offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless
world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.

The Run is managed by Peace Runs International, a non-profit
organization based in the United States.


               ----  Take a Step For Peace  ----

The Peace Runs in 1987, 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a
million participants. We're expecting even more people to join
Peace Run '93.

You can also join the Run - carrying the Peace Torch a few steps,
a few blocks or a few miles. Or you can come out and cheer the
runners as they carry the Torch through your community.

You can also join local celebrities and government officials in
one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the
70-nation route.

Your inner support is important too. If you're a runner, each time
you go out, you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.

"I would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for Humans.
I am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range

simply disallow earth like conditions.

     from the sun and the suns temperature..)

     can human bodies take day after day.  Also how does the mass effect

I know this is kinda off the subject of sci.space, but not really, I want to
answer this for their, as well as everyone else's information.  What these
people are proposing, by and large already exists and can be purchased today.

It is called labview by National Instruments.  IT is a wonderful object
oriented graphical programming language.  IT has been implemented on
both Mac's PC's and VME unix boxes.  IT is fare superior to any programming
approach that I have ever seen and allowed us to decrease the software
development time for our shuttle payloads by 90 percent.  This program is
not dependendant on specific hardware and already has exensive analysis 
capability.

Why re-invent the wheel on a platform that may not exist? It is a great
idea but look out there at what is available today.  The Hydrogen leak on
the Shuttle was found using this software. All SSME control and simulation
studies, along with the real testing at MSFC is handled with LabVIEW.  There
are tons of applications, with the ability to create ""virtual"" instruments
that can accomplish any specific custom task the maker desires.  With the
addition of IEEE-488 support, the computer becomes a virtual control station,
allowing the graphic representation of remote instrumentation. With serial
I/O support that instrument can be anywhere.  The ground control software
for the main control of SEDSAT 1 will utilize this approach.",2

with freedom remain.  in space integration,  too many flights
too build.  not enough science retrurn.

I don't think I've changed my stance at all.  My original stance was that

shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much.  Even a hanging
probably produces one sharp instance of pain, but it's over so quickly...


Pardon?


No.  Well, again I stated that a painless death isn't cruel, but I don't
think I stated that all painful executions *are* cruel.  I think that some
are cruel, depending on the nature and duration of the pain.


Anything more than an instant, I guess.  Any death by suffocation
asphyxiation, or blood loss would be cruel, I think (this includes the
gas chamber, and drawing and quartering).  I'd say that any pain that
lasts, say, over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may
be an arbitrary cutoff, I suppose).",0

Adobe Streamline has been out four a couple of years. It does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs. Of course, a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace. The problem that I've run into though, is that when it
creates a detailed trace, it produces WAY more points than are necessary.
If I trace something manually, I use many less es points. The problem
with this is it produces BIG files which slow everything down, especially

"Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's 
	Contest Announcement)

WHAT IS ACCESS.bus?

ACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer 
peripheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that 
uses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to 
a single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or 
keypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR 
gloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and 
others can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications 
such as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, 
Multiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more 
can now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts 
Plug and Play on every PC.

The ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of 
systems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host 
computer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a 
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software 
development.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-
platform use of the same device.

ACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:
=====================================

ACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone 
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without 
fee or royalty.
ACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single 
host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus 
data rate is 100 Kbits/sec.

ACCESS.bus Physical Layer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
ACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware 
protocol, with one data line and one clock line.
Standard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level 
handshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock 
synchronization.  

ACCESS.bus Software Protocols
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three 
levels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.

I2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines 
arbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C 
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with 
different clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, 
framing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the 
receiver.  

BASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between 
a host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the 
ACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an 
ACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with 
additional semantics, including checksum.
Unique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot 
plugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus 
addresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot 
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the 
system is running, without rebooting.

APPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus 
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular 
types of devices.  Each type requires a different Application 
Protocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: 
keyboards, locators, and text devices.

ACCESS.bus support on the PC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the 
PC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the 
base protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  
An ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 
- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with 
the ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for 
multiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and 
Windows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples 
of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

Bill, you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its
sole purpose the validation of atheism.  It doesn't.  This board is
used to discuss atheism as a philosophy, to share posters' experiences
regarding atheism, to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole, to
share resources relating to atheism, and even to socialize with others
with similar views.  And of course with the number of theists who come
here to preach, it is also used to argue the case for atheism. 



If you want to accuse people of lying, please do so directly.  The
phrase ""deliberately mistaken"" is rather oxymoronic.

 

The two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are
Christianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers
into good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been
accomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American
Friends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread
For The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring
to mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names
of some analagous Islamic groups?)  

When Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her
Christianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity
such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care
for those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the
power to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread
enough, it can change societies.

The same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity
had little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the
awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you
are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never
the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that
religion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.",0
"Why should anyone (check: let's restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)
want to find ""commandments"" in the books regarded as scripture?  What's
going on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more
open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is
the *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted ""at"" me often
enough by those who don't believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said
to have) said, ""If you love me, you will obey my commands.""  [John 14:15]

I am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I
should do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,
but still under His direction, though we both call God ""Abba.""  Christians,
therefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and
discovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.
Readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as ""slaves of
Christ"") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts
(whether classified as ""inspired"" or not) that are held up as models, in an
effort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges
from ""devotional"" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-
ical scripture as ""the Word of God.""  And at the highest pitch, this leads
to a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that
can act as ""absolute"" guidance for our actions.

The problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am
going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians
have looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not
because *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay
is Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the
witness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments
can we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard
question.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the
discussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike
*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason
and c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]

Earlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] ""I give you a new 
commandment: love one another.""  This is the ONLY place in the NT where
Christians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting
on its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we
*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus
says, ""Take this [bread]; this is my body.""  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,
Luke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),
and hence this, too, is a ""commandment.""

In *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider
circle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the
evangelist's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or
entirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment
from our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul's mention (at least; this
is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy
in which these words operate to ""bind"" Christians to the original command
to his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.

I am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that
it is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.
I take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST'S notion,
that *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus' command
directed at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.
The command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific
context of its statement to my own context as a ""disciple"" of Christ.

All reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out
of the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts
-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native
languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without
*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original
languages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,
that we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control
[ I don't *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current
purposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already
coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world
than the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-
vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we
can read the texts as the original audience might have done.

Among the reasons we have for seeing John's _agapate allelou_ as a *general*
commandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that
one occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic ""Great Commandment"" is
that we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom
we congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, ""You have learnt
say to you: love your enemies.""  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted
does NOT say 'hate your enemy' -- it is merely the common human presumption.
(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the ""love"" should extend to strangers
amongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,
goes on to have Jesus say. ""Even sinners love those who love them."" [6:27]
All of this suggests [quite strongly, I'd say :-)] that *limiting* the
scope of the ""new commandment"" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In
short, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command
that is ""in force"" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other
Christians.

Trickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is
the case of the ""Great Commission"" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve
are sent out to evangelize, ""Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close
at hand.""  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather
specific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in ""Do not
turn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town""
-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus' final journey to
Jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians
than the previous examples.  That hasn't prevented Christians from MAKING
such an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference
is NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by
the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to
have felt obliged to ""proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand""
even (contrary to Jesus' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to
the ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as
a ""commandment"" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I ""accept"" this?  I don't
know.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of
inference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)
infer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in
the gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this
kind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*
have an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable
length) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*
involved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural
(though people will do their best to ""justify"" their assumptions by OTHER
references to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)

Let's move on to the ""Great Commandment"" -- that we should love God with
our whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic
""equivalent"" of John's _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED
as a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with
the Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]

	""But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees
	they got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,
	""Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?""

It is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus'
answer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a
polemic from his enemies.  [ Mark's account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer
in a far more positive light as (so the ""scribe"" in this version says)
""far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word
originates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)
or sacrifice.""  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question
""to disconcert"" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains
[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one
could be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this
said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on
Christians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each
case that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears
HAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about
what WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on
our understanding the point of Jesus' use of the Torah in the (all quite
different) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.

The different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted
that ONLY in Luke do we get the ""fixing"" of this command by the parable of
the Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where
7:12 gives the ""Golden Rule"" as ""the meaning of the Law and the Prophets""
(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation
before Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely
reasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not
*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of
inter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this ""intertextuality.""

My discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ ""has"" to apply beyond the 
community of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,
applies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the
presentation not saying so explicitly) a ""commandment"" to Christians.
Few Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point
out that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains
of reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.

The contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at
those sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as 
commandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is 
pretty clear, ""The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty
of adultery against her.""  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew
has an escape clause [ ""except in the case of fornication"", 5:31 ]. This
seems to be a rather clear ""commandment"" (whether or not we take Matthew's
reservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don't,
at least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were
not explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the
things people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands
of Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists
of the synoptic tradition?

I'm going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this
is enough to start with.  The theme is: ""finding commandments in scripture
is an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,
that is, our own cultural biases.""  I have, so far, identified a very few
""commandments"" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in
these, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these
difficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce
commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no
evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn
*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or
misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that
US law refuse to allow it, or refuse ""unrepentant divorcees"" places in
their churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn't* enter into 
consideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in
even the most ""liberal"" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal
Episcopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has
recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a
""private"" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the ""public"" ceremony
he celebrated need not go through an agonizing ""examination"" by officials
who would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands
we are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively
CREATED by a famous divorce! ]",3

Perhaps you have a different understanding of what ""physics"" is.  If we
can't measure anything objectively, then the answers we get from physics
aren't objective either.  That's what I mean when I say there's no objective
physics.

Sure, we can all agree that (say) F = GMm/r^2, but that's maths.  It's only
physics when you relate it to the real world, and if we can't do that
objectively, we're stuck.  (Of course, this displays my blatant bias towards
applied science; but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real
world situations, based on real world observations.)


It's an axiom that it's invariant.  But if the two of us measure it, we'll
get different answers.  Yes, we call that experimental error, but it's not
really ""error"" in the conventional sense; in fact, if you don't get any,
that's an error :-)

You could argue that the value of c is ""objective, to within +/- <some
value>"".  But I'd call that a rather odd usage of the word ""objective"", and
it opens the way for statements like ""Murder is objectively wrong for all
people, to within 1% of the total population.""

   Think for a moment about the technology required to do that.  By

   same cost as a smallish billboard, therefore. If such ads were

This is nonsense.  Its like saying that by the time commercials

   billboards aren't the problem: They are just a symptom of 
   growing, densely-populated civilization. Banning such ads will
   not save your view of the night sky, because by the time 
   such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble
   finding a place without street lights, where you can _see_

"Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial
     when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or
     will he assume the superstition of his parents
     when questioning? 

I've often found it to be the case that the theist
     will stick to some kind of superstition when
     wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've
     seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim,
     and the other theists alike.  All assume that
     their mothers and fathers were right in the
     aspect that a god exists, and with that belief
     search for their god.
     
Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or
     aspects of the same religion, but overall the
     majority keep to the belief that some ""Creator""
     was behind the universe's existence.  I've
     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice
     versa, I've known Christians who were once
     Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known
     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout
     their transition from one faith to another,
     they've kept this belief in some form of higher
     ""being.""  Why?
     
It usually all has to do with how the child is
     brought up.  From the time he is born, the
     theist is brought up with the notion of the
     ""truth"" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,
     the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told
     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)
     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in
     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.
     He is also told that to question this (as
     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime
     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-
     ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell.
     Thus, by the time he is able to read the
     scripture for himself, the belief in its ""truth""
     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
     matter of course.
     
But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able
     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to
     inculcate the child the ""right"" readings of
     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant
     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to
     explain away the unexplainable with ""mystery.""
     Circular arguments, ""self-evdent"" facts and
     ""truths,"" unreasoning belief, and fear of
     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
     of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath
     of some sort, and the child must learn to put
     away his brain when the matter concerns God.
     All of this has some considerable effect on the
     child, so that when he becomes an adult, the 
     superstitions he's been taught are nearly
     impossible to remove.
     
All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
     truly be objective when questioning God, Hell,
     Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest.
     Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that
     God *does* exist and look at everything from
     a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most
     theists can somewhat, especially when presented
     with ""mythical gods"" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian,
     & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption
     of God's existence and question it impartially?

I would have to say that the ""greatest philosopher"" title would have to
go to Plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially
defined by him.  Although he got most of his answers wrong, he did 
definitively identify what the important questions are.  I think it
was Descartes who said that ""All philosophy is just a footnote to Plato.""

If I were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances
in human knowledge over his lifetime, that's simple...it is Aristotle.
This is so much the case that many simply refer to him as ""the philosopher"".

Regarding Nietzsche, he's one of the most entertaining, although since his
ideas were so fragmented (and since his life was cut short) it is doubtful
that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years
from now.  They'll probably still be reading him in 500 years though.

As for ""modern"" philosophers, I would have to say that Kant was the most
influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who
came after him (and unfortunately, they maintained his errors and 
amplified them over time).

I would say that the most influential ""american"" philosopher would have to
be Dewey.

But as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in
500 years, it may very well be Ayn Rand (who in every important respect

No. The library at Alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever
built in the world. The Greeks had a love of wisdom, philo sophos, and
this great love was reflected in the Alexandrian library. The Christians 
got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the Moslems 
invaded and either the Christians burned the library to keep it from falling 
into Moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners, not the 
Moslems), or it burned in the sack of the city or the Moslems burned it. 
Either way, a tremendous amount of information was lost. The destruction of the
library of Alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man
against man.


Actually, the Hebrew almah, (young woman), was translated as the Hellenistic 
Greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the
modern and technical English term virgin. The Jews did not have the type
of virginity cult that the Greco-Romans had in Artemis and Diana.


The standard text used by Christians and Jews is the Masoretic Text.
Jews of course use the text in its original Hebrew, without translation.

REVIEWETTE: ""Loompanics' Greatest Hits""
ISBN 1-55950-031-X (Loompanics)

A selection of articles picked from the books in Loompanics' catalogue.  
Subjects include:

 * Christian Dispensationalism -- how right-wing Christians encouraged 
   the Cold War
 * Satanic Child Abuse myths
 * Religion and censorship
 
Plus lots of anarchist and libertarian stuff, situationism, computers and 
privacy, and so on.  Guaranteed to contain at least one article that'll 
offend you -- like, for example, the interview with Bradley R. Smith, the 
Holocaust Revisionist.  A good sampling of stuff in a coffee table book.  (Of
course, whether you want to leave this sort of stuff lying around on your
coffee table is another matter.)

QUOTE:

""The fundamentalists leap up and down in apoplectic rage and joy.  Their 
worst fantasies are vindicated, and therefore (or so they like to think), 
their entire theology and socio-political agenda is too.  Meanwhile, teen-age
misanthropes and social misfits murder their enemies, classmates, families,
friends, even complete strangers, all because they read one of Anton LaVey's
cooks or listened to one too many AC/DC records.  The born-agains are ready

QUOTE:

""He has been known to answer questions concerning universal truths with 
screams.  With suggestive silence.  By peeing down his pants leg.  His most
famous sermon was of cosmic simplicity: ""Bob"" standing on the stage with his
hands in his pockets, smoking, looking around and saying nothing.  Heated

ISBN 0-915179-61-X (Loompanics)

The author of the Illuminatus trilogy rails against natural law, natural 
morality, objective reality, and other pervasive myths.  Witty and 
thought-provoking work from someone who actually seems to know an argument
from a hole in the ground.

QUOTE:

""Since theological propositions are scientifically meaningless, those of us
of pragmatic disposition simply won't buy such dubious merchandise. [...] 
Maybe -- remotely -- there might be something in such promotions, as there
might be something in the talking dogs and the stocks in Arabian tapioca
mines that W.C. Fields once sold in his comedies, but we suspect that we
recognize a con game in operation.  At least, we want to hear the dog talk or
see the tapioca ore before we buy into such deals.""

Never claimed it is a bug.



Never claimed it is a bug.



I guess I edited my note on this away from the article I posted to
many newsgroups.

I wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
This makes sense, because the main use of XV is only viewing images.

Doing many changes to image, we should keep all modifications
in a buffer; and then before making the operations to 24bit image,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.



Never claimed it is a bug.
I tried kept sure I don't claim that JPEG is noting else than
a compression algorithm, because I know what the JPEG is.
(You propably misunderstood what I wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

You also missed what is (were) wrong with XV. However, I did wrote it.

"More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics
workstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the
E&S Freedom.


Here is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.

------

Denali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use
a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have 
similar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market
penetration.

There remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and
E&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end
developer's dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom
systems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom
design treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose
applications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note
that KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not
require an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,
however, will remain much more flexible.

The KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.
Entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end
Freedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because
it uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting
in better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide
strong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade
them separately as needed.

Both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive
VGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide
this capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.
Aside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics
data storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable
solution.

Hope this helps,

Brian",1

Then delete the ""unfortunately"".   Now tell me that the two statement
say effectively the same thing.

And to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop, please notice
that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self.   We can choose
*not* to preserve self, which is the point of pacifism.

    First of all (this is NOT a snide response), if you're confused about
this issue, you will stumble over a lot of other things as well.  I suggest
that the weakness is your reference material.  Get ""An Introduction to Ray
Tracing"" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing
algorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.

    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For
example, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that's another issue =^).  So, you
get some illumination equation like this:

        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent

    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less
hand-waving illumination equation is this:

        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt

    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.  So the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object, for example, might be [0.4, 0.1, 0.5] for a
purple-colored glass object.

    Hopefully this answers your question.  I'll forward my ""illumination
equation sermon"" to you also.",1

"I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would
like to have in your applications.  

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the 
application.  It may let you

- manipulate application data, the camera,
  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or
- view the status of the application or 3-D objects
  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or
- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.

For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.
A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis.

I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.

2) Drawing three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional screen.

The simple answer is, you divide by the depth.  For a more verbose
explanation, see any of the above references, starting with:

The Foley & Van Dam & Feiner & Hughes ""Computer Graphics"" book is certainly
a good start.  Chapter 6 is ""Viewing in 3D"", then read chapter 15,
""Visible-Surface Determination"".  For more information go to chapter 16 for
shading, chapter 19 for clipping, and branch out from there.


3) Quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.

Find a copy of ""Color Image Quantization for Frame Buffer Display"" by
Paul Heckbert, SIGGRAPH '82 Proceedings, page 297.  There are other
algorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations
are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).

A variant method is described in ""Graphics Gems"", p. 287-293.  Note that
the code from the ""Graphics Gems"" series is all available from an FTP site,
as described above.

Check out John Bradley's ""Diversity Algorithm"", which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual.

The ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as ""doing a better job than the
other algorithms, but slower"".

There's also an implementation of:

Wan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data
Clustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),
pp. 153-162.

avialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,
in modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.


4) Converting color into grayscale.

The NTSC formula is:

    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue


5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.

The only reference you need for this stuff is:

    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6

But before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to b&w conversion.


6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.

The obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.
This is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,
loop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*
transformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.
This method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one
2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing
sub-pixel sampling.

However, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,
which involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally
created for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is
also present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: ""A Fast Algorithm for Raster
Rotation"", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics
Interface '86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in
the same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears
in ""Graphics Gems"" (see section [1]) under the original title.


7) Free image manipulation software.

There are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to
another, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus
the above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.
Here are pointers to some of them:

    xv by John Bradley.  X-based image display, manipulation, and format
    conversion package.  XV displays many image formats and permits editing
    of GIF files, among others. The program was updated 5/92; see the file

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could someone
mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers that will
send you things like this in response to a message.  See item 13 below for
details on some.

Also, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion
of software like this.  You may find useful information there.


8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.

You almost certainly don't need these.  Read the above item 7 on free
image manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and
look through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the
format documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.

These files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.
This archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object
formats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark
Hall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.

A second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,
neither of these is complete, you might want to check both.

FITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It's a file format most
often used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images
but other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and
information posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.



9) Converting between vector formats.

A lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw
to CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you
get past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects
are the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.
The basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled
round-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.
Except in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do
a one-to-one conversion between vector formats.

There is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The
contributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.
A better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.

On the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.
As far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been
posted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive
site.

A related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to
X11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for
PC's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,
the PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun's X11/NeWs can
be used to render to a file if you're clever.  But in general, the
answer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial.

GNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as
a PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements
essentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript
and level 2).


10) How to get Pixar films.

The various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available
on video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:

    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price
    Luxo, Jr.				$14.95			$50.00
    Red's Dream				$19.95			$75.00
    Tin Toy				$24.95			$75.00
    Knickknack				$24.95			$75.00
    Luxo, Jr./Red's Dream/Tin Toy	$39.95			$100.00

All tapes are on 1/2"" VHS NTSC.  Add $10/tape for PAL format.  Also
available:

    Tin Toy T-shirt			$15.00
    Knickknack 3D T-shirt		$15.00 (includes glasses)

For individual orders, add $5 S&H for the first tape or shirt, $2 for
each additional tape or shirt.  For institutional orders, add $5 S&H
for the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add
$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,
213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify
prices and availability.  Or, just write to:

    Direct Cinema Limited
    1749 14th Street
    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342

Allan Braunsdorf has this to say:

At SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts
for $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly
more than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it's
available from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar's address).

    Pixar
    1001 West Cutting Blvd.
    Richmond, CA. 94804
    (510) 236-4000 
    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)

You can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains ""Luxo, Jr."", ""Red's
Dream"", ""Tin Toy"" and ""Knicknack"" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They
will take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I 
ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don't expect 
to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license
agreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.


11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?

The short answer is, ""You can't.""  Unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,
but it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to
do the job right, consult the article:

  ""A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles""
  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller
  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,
  September, 1989, pages 48-56.

For rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:

  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture
  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,
  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.

For the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:

  ""Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves""
  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken
  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),
  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]


12) How to order standards documents.

The American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also
ISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,
mailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the
complete name and number.

Some useful numbers to know:

CGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical
Kernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer's Hierarchical
Interactive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI
Y14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;
for example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.

Standards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let
you know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering
at 1-800-854-7179.


13) How to FTP by email.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

In addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying ""help"" and it will tell you how to use
it.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.


14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.

Consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,
the point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of
edges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in
the trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines' article in
Glassner's ray tracing book (above) for more information, including
treatment of special cases.

Another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,
if the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.

Code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in
the Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:
pub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.


15) How to tessellate a sphere.

One simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The
base of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones.  Jon Leech <leech@cs.unc.edu>
has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.
It's available for FTP on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.

16) Specific references on ray-tracing and global illumination.

Rick Speer maintains a cross-indexed ray-tracing bibliography:

Highlights of this edition-

    i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through
       November '91;
    ii) papers from all Siggraph, Graphics Interface, Eurographics, CG
        International and Ausgraph proceedings through December, '91;
    iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup;
    iv) cross-indices by keyword and author;
    v)  glossary of the 119 keywords used.

The bib is in the form of a PostScript file.  The printout is 41 pages long.
Below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. It's named
""speer.raytrace.bib.ps.Z"" and is compressed at most sites-

             Site                             Dir
	wuarchive.wustl.edu	graphics/graphics/bib/RT.BIB.Speer/
	karazm.math.uh.edu	pub/Graphics/
	gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au	pub/papers/
	nic.funet.fi		pub/sci/papers/graphics
	coral.cs.jcu.edu.au     graphics/papers/

Eric Haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity/global
illumination bibliographies.  These are in ""refer"" format, and so can be
searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is
included with each).  The bibliographies are available at most of the
sites listed above, and the most current versions are maintained at
princeton.edu: pub/Graphics/Papers as ""RayBib.*"" and ""RadBib.*"".

Tom Wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray
tracing related research papers and books.  The information is essentially
in plaintext, and Latex and troff formatting programs are included.  This
collection is available at most of the sites above as ""rtabs.*"".

17) SIGGRAPH information online

[from Steve Cunningham and Ralph Orlick]

ACM-SIGGRAPH announces its online information site at  siggraph.org
(128.248.245.250).  This site now provides SIGGRAPH information via both
anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.

The anonymous ftp service is very standard, and the ftp directory includes
both conference and publications subdirectories.

To retrieve information by electronic mail, send mail to
     archive-server@siggraph.org
and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
followed by the topic and subtopic you wish.  A good place to start is with
the command
     send index
which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.


18) SIGGRAPH Panels Proceedings available

[from Steve Cunningham and Bob Judd]

ACM SIGGRAPH announces the availability of the SIGGRAPH '91 Panels Proceedings
at the  siggraph.org  site (128.248.245.250).  The proceedings are available
in three formats:
     text   (ASCII)
     rtf    (rich text format, suitable for many word processors)
     word   (MS Word for the Macintosh)
They may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways:

(1) by anonymous ftp
    change to one of the directories
       publications/s91/panels_proceedings/[text|rtf|word]
    The text and rtf files may be downloaded in ASCII mode, while the word
    files are stored in MacBinary format and must be downloaded in binary 
    mode.

    Each directory contains a Table of Contents file (TOC) that describes the
    contents of each panel file.

(2) by electronic mail
    send mail to
       archive-server@siggraph.org
    You can retrieve either the  text  or  rtf  files.  We suggest that you
    first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages
       send panel91-txt index
       send panel91-rtf index
    in the subject or body of the message.  You will get the necessary
    information to retrieve the actual transcript files.


19) Graphics mailing lists

There are a variety of graphics-related mailing list out there, each
covering either a single product or a single topic.  I have been an
active participant in one of these for some time now, and find the
focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
to be nothing short of amazing.

Please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you
would like to see added.

    Graphics File Formats, David Kay and John Levine, Windcrest/McGraw-Hill
      1992, ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 paper, ISBN 0-8306-3060-0 $36.95 hardcover,
      ISBN 0-8306-3059-7 $24.95 paper.  Comments - 26 formats, no software
      (this is good, IMHO - I prefer books which are non-platform-dependent).
      Questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.


21) What about GIF?

GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format.  It is portable and usable upon
a wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the
keeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don't like
it much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question
which was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list
of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.

22) What is morphing?

Warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new
location. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.
Valerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
morphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au
in the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:

        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)
        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)
        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)

The files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and
uncompress them afterwards.


23) How to ray-trace height fields

Height fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,
such as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they
get their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be
located via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.

The following paper seems to be the definitive reference:

F. Kenton Musgrave
Grid Tracing: Fast Ray Tracing For Height Fields
July, 1988
<musg88.ps.Z>

This is available as ""Research Report YALEU/DCS/RR-639"" from Yale University,
it's also in the SIGGRAPH '91 Fractal Modeling in 3D Computer Graphics and
Imaging course notes, and (best of all) it's available on the net:

24) How to find the area of a 3D polygon

	The area of a triangle is given by (in C notation),

     area = 0.5 * ( ( x[0] * y[1] ) + ( x[1] * y[2] ) + ( x[2] * y[0] ) -
	            ( x[1] * y[0] ) - ( x[2] * y[1] ) - ( x[0] * y[2] ) );

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

     area = 0.0;

     for ( i = 0; i < n - 1; i++ )
         area += ( x[i] * y[i + 1] ) - ( x[i + 1] * y[i] );
     area += ( x[n - 1] * y[0] ) - ( x[0] * y[n - 1] );
     area /= 2.0;

If the area is a negative number, the polygon or triangle is
clockwise, if positive, it is counterclockwise.

 of Planar Polygons and Volume of Polyhedra:""

The area of a polygon P0, P1, P2, ... Pn, not in the x-y plane, is
given by

     Area(Polygon) = 1/2 * | N . Sigma { Pk x Pk+1 } |

where N is the unit vector normal to the plane and P is a polygonal
vertex.  The . represents the dot product operator and the x
represents the cross product operator.  Sigma represents the summation
operator.  | | represents the absolute value operator.  Pn+1 is equal
to P0.


25) How to join ACM/SIGGRAPH

Probably the easiest way to join ACM/SIGGRAPH is to trot over to your
local technical library and find a copy of Communications of the ACM.
Somewhere within the first few pages will be an application blank.
Fill it out and mail it in.  ACM membership for students costs $23.00,
Voting or Associate Membership $77.00 (yearly)

SIGGRAPH student membership costs an additional $16.00, $26.00 for
Voting or Associate Members (also yearly).  To get TOG (Transactions
on Graphics) it's another $26.00 for students and $31.00 for Voting or
Associate Members.

If you just want to join SIGGRAPH without joining ACM, it'll cost you
$59.00 (no student discount).

There are surcharges for overseas airmailing of publications.

ACM Member services may be contacted via email at acmhelp@acmvm.bitnet.

Why? How? Might makes right? How can they force their morality on me? Why 
can't I do what I want? Who are they to decide? What if I disagree? 

Good point, but it is being immoral in our opinion.  We don't let them choose,
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.

  For someone to lay claim to an alternative

I admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense, but have little basis
for it as of yet.  How far can such a concept be extended?

 and

Do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
not him.  After all, he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
chose.  On what basis do we condemn other societies besides, here's the buzz 
words, on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all 
societies?

  Holding that morality is subjective does not mean

Why not? Do we have to be objective suddenly?

I posted that document (forgot part 1/6 etc) but it was more than a summary,
it was a complete technical description of the protocol. It can be ftped
from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors/msdos/naplps


Why not write a NAPLPS decoder for your choice of platform and release the
code to the net? Then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.
NAPLPS was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as X, but while X is intended for high-bandwidth network connections,
NAPLPS was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.

I'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. If you
wanted to provide a full network connection to Linux over a modem would you
use SLIP/PPP or would you invent some new way? Most people would say that
SLIP/PPP exist and are reasonably well designed protocols, so lets just
implement them. I see it the same way with NAPLPS. It is an existing, well
thought out, extensible protocol for online graphics, so why not implement
it.

If you need any advice on implementation, just e-mail me. I am currently
getting a beta version of my CorelDraw to NAPLPS converter working well
enough to release it by May 15. If you or someone else does not get going
on a freely available NAPLPS decoder, then I intend to do it after I get
a my conversion program out of beta, and get a couple of other things done.

"Pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable
Myco-toxin,  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing
Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It's immediate
administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving
problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially
enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,
the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,
and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then
aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide
class of infections.

Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised
amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.
It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and
developement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times
of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration
with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.
The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is
implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some
patients.

I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin,
but to centoxin.",2

Once the Rushdie situation exploded into the media, the Muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of Muslim demonstrations. For every twenty or so
newspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there
would
appear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the
situation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying.)

Rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
""organized""
Islam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam
which Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a ""secular"" Islam - an Islam
separated from it's Qur'an, it's Prophet, God, its legislation, and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie
made
his views known - the Muslim's made their anger at his book known. The
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this
time,
already a political situation - affecting governments as well as
individuals.
The situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.
At the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

Now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind, has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in ""boldly""
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular ""heroic Knight"",mounted on the his media steed,
 doing battle with the ""dragon"" of Islamic ""fundamentalism"".

Well Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who 
grew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim's hold dear, 
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -
who, when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,
continued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.
Khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths
of Muslims around the world and Rushdie's continued media mischief
even after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the
centre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the
continuing mischief - all media support, government support was
just that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief
making, was applied to Rushdie.


I have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. ""Image"" is
the chief concern of Muslim 'apologists' for Islam and for Rushdie.
If Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture
within a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam
would then be thought to have a good ""image"" (Principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). A ""good image"" usually means "" be
more
like me"".

Your attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

#
#>#      Ah, that old chestnut, your claim that moral objectivism ==
#>#scientific objectivism. I don't agree with it; now try proving, through
#>#some objective moral test, that my disagreeing is incorrect. =)
#> 
#> Your claim, which you have deleted now was ""not universal => not objective"".
#
#      I've deleted it now, in the interest of brevity. Go back a step
#and you'll see it was still in your post. Yes, that was my claim; if you
#can refute it, then please do so.

Firstly, an apology.  You hadn't deleted your claim, and I was mistaken in
saying you had. Sorry for any offence caused.

Secondly,  how can I refute your definition?  I can only point up its
logical implications, and say that they seem to contradict the usage
of the word ""objective"" in other areas.  Indeed, by your definition, an
objective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that
belief, other than that it is useless, and that ""objective"" is a perfectly
good word.

#> So, what *is* objective?  Not the age of the universe, anyway, as I show
#> above.
#
#      How many ages can the universe have, and still be internally self-
#consistent? I'd be amazed if it was more than one. How many different
#moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single
#individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?

Begging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age
of the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are
saying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about
it.  Why?

#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be
#emirically verified through means that'll give the same result no matter
#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the
#largish side...). 

This assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality
which doesn't depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical
Creationist give a rat's ass about the means of which you speak?

#I've heard of no way to verify morality in a
#consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to
#enlighten me?

The same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted
to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.  I wrote
elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.
If a moral system makes a prediction ""It will be better if..."",
that can be tested, and is falsifiable in the same way as a prediction
""This drug will relieve pain...""

#      People's *ideas* about the age of object X are *not* objective;
#you can have any idea you like, and I can't stop you. Universae and
#their ages is another ballgame; they are what they are, and if you
#dislike some detail of them, that's a problem with your *opinion* of
#them. 

Sure.  Assume an objective reality, and you get statements like this.

#I claim that morality is an opinion of ours, and as such
#subjective and individual. If I'm wrong, then some more-or-less
#objectively ""real"" thing exists, which you label ""objective morality"";
#can you back up this positive claim of existence?

Can you back up your positive claim above?  No.  That's because it's an
assumption.  I make the same assumption about values, on the basis
that there is no logical difference between the two, and the empirical
basis of the two is precisely the same.

#>#      Point: Morals are, in essence, personal opinions. Usually
#>#(ideally) well-founded, motivated such, but nonetheless personal. The
#>#fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question,
#>#sometimes even for the same reason, does not make morals objective; it
#>#makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question,
#>#which can be good for the evolution of a social species.
#> 
#> And if a ""real large lot"" (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a 
#> football on a desk, I'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two?  
#> Perhaps you can explain the difference to me, since you seem to see it
#> so clearly.
#
#      Take a look on the desk - i.e., perform a test. If(football) THEN
#(accept theory) ELSE DO (Tell people they're hallucinating).
#
#      Now take a look at morality. See anything? If so, please inform me
#which way to look, and WHY to look that particular way, as opposed to
#some other. Get my drift?

No. Just look.  Are you claiming never to know what good means?

#>#      *Science* is a whole other matter altogether.
#> 
#> Says you.  Prove that those who disagree are wrong?
#

Zoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that,
in a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being
Hebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully
introduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority 
of the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has
Kethuvim or Writing status.]

Ref: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:

DANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.
Daniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in
the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his
salvation from death in a lion's pit. He also appears in the last chapters of
the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel's
restoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in
the court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-
forms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel
7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him
decode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name
Daniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known
from Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).
  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative
voices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in
Hebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels
the subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;
7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The
overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7
is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the
prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some
youths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a
sequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of
this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,
Daniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar's transformation into a beast, a story that
is reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the
last king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede
who conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such
Darius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of
several Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a
series of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of
miraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to
mid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine
providence and encourage steadfast faith.
  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to
that of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in
Palestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior
to the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews
were put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral
traditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a
martyr's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions
of Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of
the enthronement of a God of judgment, with a ""son of man"" invested with rule
(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians
as Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre
manifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient
prophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.
  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four
metals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth
monarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-
vived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes
to the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the
fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the
scientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth
Monarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony
to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of
diverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various
groups predicting the apocalyptic advent.
  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and
propagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah
52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as
the select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor
the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather
advocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.
Victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the
martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the
circles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may
reflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of
resistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic
integrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of
the God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of
trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.",3

Ah, you taking everything as literal quotation.  No wonder you're confused.

I'd guess that it might be.


It may be the case that some people are unable to evaluate complex moral
issues.  Rather than leaving them to behave ""immorally"", it might be better
to offer them an abstract (nonexistent objective) system of ethics which they
can strive towards, coded into rules which they don't have to derive for
themselves.

"I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations
rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is
utterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to
BATSE press releases.
The idea behind the statement is as follows: 
     ""if you smack two neutron
      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,
      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a
      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy 
      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes
      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.
      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must
      be wrong.""
As so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who
was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It
may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray
burst, but the 'fireball' of energy and matter that is created
may spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding 
medium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may
carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All
this is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,
Peter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.
It is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one
around (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative
proposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the 
so-called 'failed supernovae' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which
a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black
hole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter
will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal
force, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the
black hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,
which again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such
events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,
but the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate
of bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two
scenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less
in the failed supernova scenario.

On another note: I do believe that the distance scale must 
ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method
such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,
or finding a definitive signature of some known class of
objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes. Theorists
have historically not been too successfull in finding the
distance of any object by proving that there is only one
possible way in which the object can work, and therefore
it *must* be so-and-so.",2
"Dale sez;

I don't buy it.  If the things had no value at all, people wouldn't
spend money to make them. So their lack of value is just your
opinion, not an actual fact, which is neither a philisophical or
legal basis for prohibiting them.

On the other hand, I lived in OakBrook IL for a while, where zoning
laws prohibit billboards, as you mention above.  I think it was a
fine law, despite it's contradictory basis.

I would guess that the best legal and moral basis for protest would
be violation of private property.  ""I bought this house, out in
the boondocks, specifically to enjoy my hobby, amateur astronomy.  Now
this billboard has made that investment worthless, so I want the
price of the property, in damages.""  It wouldn't take too many
succesful cases like that to make bill-sats prohibitively expensive.

(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
      The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".
        d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
+       'w' or 'W' to pause, any key to continue.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.
+     pressing F5 will turn on 'effect' menu.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,
     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
     I need your suggestion to improve this program.

III/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael's?) had a lot in
common with the British Interplanetary Society's Daedalus project for sending a
probe to Barnard's Star - i.e. a large ""bus"" spacecraft carrying several
smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.
The Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards
Jupiter and beyond. The ""bus"" could have included far more powerful
cameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power
source than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.
Extremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements
within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a
relatively great distance.
---
The smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the ""real"" Voyagers,
and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in
the early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during
the mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the
same basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in
addition two ""sub-probes"" could have been relased at Saturn, examining
that planet's south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have
enabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several
other probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune
systems that weren't examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to
trajectory-related factors. A small ""swarm"" of camera-equipped miniature space
probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a 
small Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, 
well-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer
planets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of
course.

Well, as I remember Jacoby's ""Mythmaker"" talks about this to cite
one source -- but I'm not sure if all Christians have read this book.
In addition my social experiences is from being raised and educated
as a Lutheran, having a lot of Christian friends, and I even
have played in two Christian rock bands!

So, over to you, do you have any counter claims, sources et 
rest that shows that Christianity does not have the concept
of a social promise that is independent on the social status?

"Thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my 
question about which countries engage in space surveillance. 
Unfortunately, I apparently didn't make the meaning of the message 
clear, since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance, 
rather than space surveillance 

     What I meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at 
the Earth (satellite reconnaissance) , but _was_ which countries have 
programs to detect and track (i.e., determine the orbital elements of) 
satellites as they pass overhead (space surveillance). 

    The US uses missile-defense radars, supplemented by a fascinating 
quasi-radar operated by the Navy, to do this for satellites in LEO, and 
electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5,000 km or so. 
The FEE, I understand, does much the same thing. 

    Amateur satellite observers use eyeballs, binoculars, stopwatches 
and PCs for objects out to around 1500 km, enabling them to keep track 
of satellites for which, ah, official element sets aren't available. 
See the fascinating books by Desmond King-Hele for details, as well as 
the files in the molczan directory on kilroy.jpl.nasa.gov.  The 
material posted in my previous message suggests that Japan engages in 
optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree, and it may be 
that other countries do also. 

    Which was the question I meant to ask: who are they, how do they do 
it, and why do they do it?

I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have
been referring to; one problem with a highly-interpreted tradition
like this is what happens when a schism occurs, and over time certain
large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor
exactly a ""face value"" interpretation...


While the context of the time is important, value judgments must
ultimately be according to current understanding, or at least to some
base standard (relative stability/success of a society, e.g.).  This
is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,
for instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were
immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look
rather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in
what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is
symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of
whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the
Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence
that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time
were particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.


Sounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see
no support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane
neighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn't mean that
the actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such
dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or
even of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.


Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance
claiming that Hammurabi's ""an eye for an eye"" was primitive brutal
retribution, while Moses' version was an enlightened benign fine
(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As
of 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.


I don't belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual
ones, of the Jewish people.  I have given up on trying to think by
analogy, since I don't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all
similar (the closest I can think of are the Romany, but I don't know
enough about them to make a meaningful comparison).  I think a
tradition of reflective study, of flexible rather than dogmatic
interpretation, is a good thing.  I think that with such an attitude a
case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a
1943 Captain America comic (or whatever the Babylonian equivalent
would have been).

        It should be remembered that all of the first reports came from 
       the FBI, and that independent observers, i.e. the press, were not 
       allowed to get close and see things for themselves.  Official 
       communiques tend to be self-serving for the agencies that issue 
       them. 
        People in general tend to believe first reports, as these get 
       the most and the biggest headlines.  Corrections are often 
       overlooked. 
         An example is the FBI report that several of the bodies found 
       in the rubble had bullet wounds.  The local coroner, who is 
       independent of the FBI, has so far found no bullet wounds! ",3

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

Commercial:

  Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price
  is about $100. Their address is:
	VRL
	2341 Ganador court
	San Luis Obispo,
	CA 93401
	Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515

  Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.
  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

SCRY
----
[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:

[ Based on a list from cristy@dupont.com < Cristy > , which asked for
 systems for displaying Molecular Dynamics, MD for short ]

Flex
----
  It is a public domain package written by Michael Pique, at The Scripps
  Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. Flex is stored as a compressed,
  tar'ed archive (about 3.4MB) at perutz.scripps.edu [137.131.152.27], in
  pub/flex. It displays molecular models and MD trajectories.

MacMolecule
-----------
  (for Macintosh). I searched with Archie, and the most
  promising place is sumex-aim.stanford.edu (info-mac/app, and
  info-mac/art/qt for a demo)

MD-DISPLAY

  I am writing my own visualization code right now.  I look at MD output
  (a specific format, easy to alter for the subroutine) on PC's.  My
  program has hooks into GKS.  If your friend has access to Phigs for X
  (PEX) and fortran bindings, I would be happy to share my evolving code
  (free of charge).  Right now it can display supercells of up to 65
  atoms (easy to change), and up to 100 time steps, drawing nearest
  neighbor bonds between 2 defining nn radii.  It works acceptably fast
  on a 10Mhz 286.

------------------------
  I'm working on molecular dynamic too.  A friend of mine and I have

  developed a program to display an MD run dynamically on Silicon
  Graphics.  We are working to improve it, but it doesn't work under X,
  we are using the graphi. lib. of the Silicon Gr. because they are much
  faster then X.  When we'll end it we'll post on the news info about
  where to get it with ftp. (Will be free software).

XBall V2.0
----------
  Written by David Nedde. Call daven@maxine.wpi.edu.

XMol
----
  An X Window System program that uses OSF/Motif  for  the
  display and  analysis  of  molecular  model data.  Data from several
  common file formats can be read and written; current formats include:
  Alchemy, CHEMLAB-II, Gaussian, MOLSIM, MOPAC, PDB, and MSCI's XYZ
  format (which has been designed  for  simplicity  in  translating to
  and from other formats). XMol also allows for conversion between
  several of these formats.

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of
  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in
  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the
  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,
  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send
  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

MAP II
------
  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

CLRview
-------
  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.

  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports
  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,
  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) 
  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.

No, MIS folks have infinite budgets of death, and they also get parts
of their budget allocated ""upgrades"", ""maintenance"", and ""new purchases"",
and a lot of IBM mainframe purchases are actually ""leases"" and so
is the software.

Basically, the engineers who have tight budgets, i.e. the coders and
designers of a company, bitch and moan when they drop 15,000 on a 
Sparc 1 only to see a faster machine appear a year later.  MIS types
upgrade once every 5-10 years, and their costs are amortized and
depreciated over a longer period, and the budget office justifies
the expense because they actually use the machines for accounting,
payroll, etc.

Now, if the budget office was dependant on the engineers for some
reason like payroll and accounts, you'd sure as hell see every
engineer with a new Cray on his desktop every year. :-)",1

Ah! Excellent. So why doesn't she appear to me? I'm a little weak in the

"FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE

          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24
          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-
          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-
          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-
          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was
          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS
          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-
          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and
          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS
          users  to  ""take  charge of your PHIGS"" by participating in PHIGS
          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS
          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,
          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  ""beyond
          PHIGS"".

          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following
          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,
          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented
          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS
          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and
          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The
          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-
          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools
          based on PHIGS.

          Next year's conference is planned for March, 1994.

          PHIGS EVERYWHERE

          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated
          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to
          mainframes.

          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including
          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing
          and translucency.

          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-
          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.  FIGARO+  PRO  is designed to add
          advanced rendering to the existing PHIGS+ API, with features like
          ray   tracing,  materials,  anti-aliasing  and  texture  mapping.
          Radiosity support is also planned.

          FIGARO+ is an example of how TGS continues to add newly  emerging
          graphics  features to their products.  FIGARO+ supports immediate
          mode extensions to PHIGS and also supports SUN XGL,  HP  Starbase
          and SGI GL/OpenGL. FIGARO+ for NT will be released this summer.

          TGS also demonstrated the latest versions of FIGraph, a  powerful
          ""2-call""  charting  system  based on PHIGS+, and FIGt, an object-
          oriented utility library for PHIGS/PEX developers.

          G5G and Gallium Software demonstrated a new version of GPHIGS  on
          Silicon  Graphics  workstations. Scheduled for summer, 1993, Ver-
          sion 3.0 of GPHIGS, the company's  PHIGS+  library  for  worksta-
          tions,  will include an advanced PHIGS debugger that allows PHIGS
          developers to display and browse PHIGS structures and other PHIGS
          internal  state.  G5G  also  described  their Non-Duplicated Data
          Store that stores pointers to application data in the GPHIGS  CSS
          for  more  efficient  use  of  memory. In addition, G5G described
          their application GSE that allows application callback  functions
          during  GPHIGS traversal.  GPHIGS and PHIGURE, G5G's data visual-
          izer and application development toolkit, are currently available
          on  all  major  workstations  that support GL, X Windows, PEX, or
          Starbase.

          Wise Software presented a slide show of  Z-PHIGS  for  MS-Windows
          and ARENA, a PHIGS based modeller/render. Z-PHIGS implements most
          of the PHIGS+ primitives.  In addition Z-PHIGS has built in  many
          advanced  rendering features like texture mapping, shadow genera-
          tion, area quick updates and ray tracing. A demo disk of  Z-PHIGS
          or ARENA is available on request.

          ATC exhibited GRAFPAK-PHIGS, their full-featured PHIGS  implemen-
          tation  based  on  DEC  PHIGS. GRAFPAK-PHIGS is available on most
          workstation platforms with C, FORTRAN and Ada bindings and incor-
          porates PEX support.

          Within the booth sponsored by Advanced Technology Center, Digital
          Equipment  Corporation demonstrated DEC PHIGS V2.4 running on the
          DEC 3000/400 AXP PXG. ATCs' GRAFPAK-PHIGS is a port of DEC PHIGS.
          DEC  PHIGS  V2.4 contains most PHIGS and PHIGS PLUS features with
          support for PEX V5.1  protocol.  DEC  PHIGS  also  contains  most
          GM/EDS   PHIGS  extensions  including  post-to-view  as  well  as
          proprietary extensions to support immediate  mode  rendering  and
          the use of PHIGS in an X11 environment.

          The IBM exhibit featured a GTO accelerator attached to an IBM 340
          workstation running graPHIGS and PEX.

          Hewlett Packard and SHOgraphics demonstrated at the conference. A
          Hewlett  Packard  machine was coupled to display on a SHOgraphics
          PEX terminal. HP showcased their latest  PHIGS  product  enhance-
          ments.

          The PHIGS Users Group was formed to aid the development of  PHIGS
          applications  and provide user feedback to PHIGS implementors and
          PHIGS standards bodies.  For more  information  about  the  PHIGS

"The OTIS Project presents...

       SYNERGY: Revolt 
	...the first in a continuing series of collaborative
	art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity
	of the infosphere.  This series of diversely 
	structured art-manipulation projects will attempt
	to stretch across network boundries encouraging
	use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography,
	scanned ""conventional"" art and even sound to 
	create multi-artist ""still"" visuals in GIF and 
	JPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels
	are welcome.  

	REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be 
	three stages of production.  The first stage will
	consist of all participants creating one still 
	work as a ""starter"" piece that two other partici-
	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage
	""base"" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993, 
	midnight Central Daylight Time. 

	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will 
	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant
	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see 
	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist
	of filtering the image through their favorite paint
	program.  For ""analog"" artists, this may well be
	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their
	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-
	ning in the image again to be transferred on to 
	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works
	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.

	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think 
	it takes to finish up the image they've been given
	using whatever technique they see as worthy.  
	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.

	All involved will participate in each stage of
	creation.

The alt.* hierarchie is created for 2 purposes:
1. For groups which do not fit under the comp.* or other 'official'
  hierarchies
2. For the fast creation of hot new newsgroups like alt.gulf.war

Because there is no voting process or any other control facilities,
sites are free to decide not to carry (some of) the alt groups.

"My theory is that Koresh was seriously wounded in the initial gunbattle
and died on Day 9 of the siege.  On Day 11 of the siege he rose from the
dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the FBI over the
next 40 days.  Living with someone who's risen from the dead isn't easy,
as Timmy Baterman's father in *Pet*Sematary* could attest, so after 40
days they did what Baterman did--shot themselves and burned the place
to the ground.

Consistent with the facts, isn't it?  Did anyone actually *see* Koresh
between Day 9 and Day 11?",3

Someone from NASA posted that there were very significant mass margins
on the HST re-boost mission.  A while back i had asked why not carry
the EDO pallet up,  and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough, they weren't even carrying extra suits.


Where's wingo when you need him:-)

COme on.   Knock that S**T off.

YOu forget,  that during skylab,  they did  overnight mission planning
for the repair EVA's.   Also during theøÄ   
Intelsat Mission,   they did overnight  WETF simulations.
I somehow think they could train up a new  EVA in  8 months.

And as for building hardware,  anything can  be built if you want it
bad enough.

YOu forget,  the  BUS 1  is already built.  all they'd ahve to do
is soup it up, even test it  on a delta mission.

Don't get into this mode of  negativism.   besides,  at the rate
missions slip,   the Discovery won't launch on this mission until
March.  that's almost a year.


Ah,  but how much more expensive is the Second HST servicing mission.

YOu forget,  there is a bum FGS,  the Solar array electronics, are
getting hinky  and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission.

The time for the space walks are growing rapidly.  THis was orignally
planned out as 3 spacewalks,  now they are at 5 EVA's  with 3 reserve
walks.

If the SMT can avoid a second servicing mission that's $500 million
saved.  If the Weight savings,  means they  can sit on orbit  for 30 Days.
and  handle any contingency  problems,  that's quite a savings.



Of course,  there wasn't any need for the Saturn  V  after apollo too.

as for the problems with the aperture door,  I am sure they can
work out some way to handle  that.  Maybe a Plug  made from
Frozen ice.?   it'll keep out any contamination,
yet sublime away  after teh boost.",2

I disagree.  It think the average joe is interested/curious about spaceflight
but sees it as an elitist activity.  Not one which he is ever going to
participate in.


Why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details
of long term space habitation?  I like the idea of the study, but it should
be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it.
If you want a general public document, you'll need a more general publication.


As one working on Controlled Ecological Life Support Systems, engineering
the microworld isn't the problem.  The problem is understanding the basic
chemical, biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them
efficiently.  For example, the only way we know how to produce food is from
plants and animals.  Food synthesis is not very far advanced.  So we have
to orbit a farm.  Well that's obviously not very efficient, so we use 
technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of 
using dirt.  This is where the engineering comes in.  But new technologies
bring new basic questions that we don't have the answers to.  Like, in 
dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other, but in 
hydroponics it turns out that you can't do that.  The lettuce growth is 
stunted when it's grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes.  So 
now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar
interactions.  This means some basic applied scientific research.  And that's
what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far.
We also need to find out how they interact together.  That's where we are now.


First you need to do the literature search.  There is a lot of information
out there.  Maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation.
This could be useful, especially if we make it available on the net.  Then
we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies.


Unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net,
I think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search 
first.  Then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis.  The data
base itself could be useful for future engineers.

That's my response Ken, what do you think?",2

said re. Dan Schaertel's article [if I followed the quoting right]:




I think it may also be worthwhile pointing out that if we
take the appellation `Rabbi' seriously then Jesus had a full
grasp of contemporary `scripture'

Mat21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures...

Mat22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing
Mat22:29 the scriptures, nor the power of God.

Following from this, he would have been in a wonderful
position to fulfil prophesies, and the NT says as much:

Mat26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled,
Mat26:54 that thus it must be?

Mat26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the
Mat26:56 prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples
Mat26:56 forsook him, and fled.

If the books comprising the referred-to `scripture' had not
been accessible then it probably would be a different
matter.",0

Sun was going to drop their development of Newsprint, and, in return for this,
Adobe was going to port Illustrator and Photoshop to Sun.  Other than the
articles that appeared in the trade journals immediately after, I haven't
heard a peep about it.  I hope it's still in the works.

This is a very good point. I have already made the clear claim that
Khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the Qur'an
and have given my arguments for this. This is something that can be
checked by anyone sufficiently interested. Khomeini, being dead,
really can't respond, but another poster who supports Khomeini has
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. This should
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
modes of obfuscationism. 

So, to answer your question, the only way you can judge is by learning 
more about Islam, that is by reading the Qur'an and understanding it's 
basic principles. Once one has done this it is relatively easy to see 
who is following the principles of Islam and who is acting in a way at 
odds with Islam. Khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve 
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles 
of Islam, which is that no human being is metaphysically different than 
any other human being and in no sense any closer to God in metaphysical 
nature.

": I heard about the arms sale to Saudi Arabia.  Now, how is it such a grave

Saudi Arabia is an oppressive regime that has been recently interfering
in the politcs of newly renunified Yemen, including assasinations and 
border incursions. It is entirely possible that they will soon invade.
Unluckily for Yemen it is not popular in the West as they managed to put
aside political differences during reunification and thus the West has
effectively lost one half (North?) as a client state.",0

     June 1992, from the Institute for Creation Research).  This is one
     of the most offensive articles they've ever published--but at least
     it argues *against* a deathbed conversion.  There's a part of the
     article even worse than what I've just quoted, in which an excerpt
     from a reader's letter says that if Asimov is burning in hell now,
     ""then he certainly has had a 180-degree change in his former beliefs
     about creation and the Creator.""  (A post-deathbed conversion.)",0

Not true. Only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole
will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon. In the
particle's own reference frame, it takes a very finite time to reach the
horizon and the singularity. The math does indeed predict this. Take a look
at Mitchner, Thorne, and Wheeler's _Gravitation_.

That (""complicated"") isn't in fact where P(H) > P(HG) comes from; it's more
the other way around. It's from

  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG')  where G' is the complement of G

and by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).

In a sense, HG is necessarily more ""complicated"" than H for any H and G,
so I may be splitting hairs, but what I'm trying to say is that irrespective
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)
holds, with equality if and only if P(HG') = 0.


Well, ""P(x | A) = P(x | B)"" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is
operative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between
the respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference
reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior
probabilities P(A) and P(B):

  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>

    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)

where k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).

So A and B are ""equally consistent with the data"" in that observing x
doesn't give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.

In the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their
prior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don't know
the actual values, and it's this which allows us to deploy the Razor to
throw out any such HG.


That's certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or
not a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion
in addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious
implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.

Now it seems to me, as I've said, that the observed variance in religious
belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather
*less* well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition, since I would
expect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual
exclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn't
even equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,
G is `divine component', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily
acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.


Not that I'm a statistician as such either, but:

The idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of
the (read `my') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with
which I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be
answered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable
to statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in
measurable ways.

This means that these regions of the space of possible observations, 
which I loosely termed ""appearances of god/s"", have some nonzero
probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.

Since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to
scatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism
expends on making ""appearances of god/s"" possible must come from somewhere
else (i.e. other possible observations).

All else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn't* an
""appearance of god/s"" must have a slightly higher probability under
atheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such
observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of
the atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease
in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.

Sorry if that's still a bit jargonesque, but it's rather difficult to
put it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties
of conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total
area under them is always unity.

An analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is ""the
coin is fair"", and that B is ""the coin is unfair (two-headed)"". (I've
used A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)

Then

  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1
  P(T | A) = 0.5  }

  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1
  P(T | B) = 0    }

The observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible
with both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability
expended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they
don't actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must
be unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance
of heads.

Say our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The
observation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are
modified according to

                            P(H | A)
  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m
                              P(H)

and

                            P(H | B)
  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m
                              P(H)

Now we don't know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but
the multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time
the coin is tossed and a head is observed.

Thus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have

                 n
  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)

and
                    n
  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),

and since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1
and thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must
decrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must
increase, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.

The loose analogy is between ""unfair coin"" and atheism, and between ""fair
coin"" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which
would falsify ""unfair coin"", is analogous to an ""appearance of god/s"",
which would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends
to the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle
is the same.



Quite so, but this type of theism is what I might call ""the G in the HG"",
in terms of our Ockham's Razor discussion, and I'd bin it on those grounds.


The hypotheses don't have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model',
the theism isn't falsifiable.



You don't have to. We don't need, in the above analogy, to know *any*
prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the
fair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding
multiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.
You don't need to know the initial values of the running estimates
either. It's clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)
approaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.

All you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for
observed x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain
events rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible
under Ha, and all else is equal.


Any observations you like; it really doesn't matter, nor affect the
reasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which
would count as ""appearances of god/s"". Examples of this might be
a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of
revelation.



OK, we'll downgrade ""*does* interact"" to ""*may* interact"", which would
actually be better since ""does interact"" implies a falsifiability which
we both agree is misplaced.


I'll explain, but bear in mind that this isn't central; all I require of
a theism is that it *not* make the prediction ""Appearances of god/s will
never happen"", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum
mechanics doesn't make this prediction either, the difference is that
QM and atheism do not form a partition.)

Predictions include such statements as ""Prayer is efficacious"" (implying
""If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious""), or ""Prayer
is *not* efficacious"", or ""Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not
pass, till all these things be fulfilled."" I don't think we have any problems
of misunderstanding here.



That's fine; I don't claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite
number of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and
that as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.




I think you are; an ""appearance of god/s"" is sufficient to falsify
atheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.


No: by way of a counterexample, let X = ""the coin is fair"", or more
accurately (so that not(X) makes sense) ""the two sides of the coin are
different"". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of
heads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite
number of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,
and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.




Oops. Sorry. Mea culpa.


We agree here.


""The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992."" Said Rapture would have
falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure
to happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which
specifically predicted it.

""No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its
explanation will ever be observed."" That about sums the whole thing up.

Well, the best thing to do is to read the book ""Parallel Universes""
by Dr. Fred Wolf. 

In essence, Dr. Wolf says that one interpretation of the sub-atomic
particle/wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually
an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid, and in each of
these universes there is a particle in a different location. When we
do something to make a particle ""appear,"" we are actually causing
all the parallel universes to collapse into one. Apparently this is
one line of thought on the nature of QM, that is going through some
of the scientific community.

Dr. Wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused
by the mental effort of observing the particle. This implys that
mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. He then extrapolates
that if mind is an integral part of the universe, then perhaps consciousness
is the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it/themself(s).

It all gets rather interesting, but what I find facinating is that
this would explain the phenomenon of ""magick"" as practiced in my
religion. Dr. Wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind
could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of
possible futures; he says that this might be done by some sort of
communication between ones current, and possible future selves. 
I have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self
delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection
of one of many possible futures.

I realize that this gets pretty bizarre, but it never hurts to keep 
an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile 
explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. After all, the
more we learn about the universe in which we live, the more we learn
that it is truly a very strange place.

Arthur (not paying much attention to Zaphod, but needing a random seed for

Actually, it may be Marvin who uses this phrase a few times as well, and
everytime it's arranged such that ""Think of a number, any number"" could be
an answer to someone's question about the Question.

2)  projected  orbital parameters after re-boost.

3)  Discovery's  DRY weight

4) HST's Dry weight.

I think 2-3 moths should be adequate.


Also because they significantly lacked on-orbit EVA experience.  
The HST is designed for on-orbit servicing.  it should be a lot easier.


There comes a time in every project, to kill the management.

They can if neccessary, re-schedule the  HST mission.  December is
not a drop dead date, unlike say the LDEF retrieval mission.  



I suspect, the BUS-1, may not have enough basic thrust for the HST
re-boost.  it mayu need bigger tanks,  or bigger thrusters.


My understanding is the Second HST servicing mission is not
a contingency.  My understanding is the mission  needs both
a new FOC  and work on the electrical system,  plus
another re-boost.

"I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system?

Welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

This is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups.

Many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions, mis-statements or misconceptions and post
them to the net.  In addition, people often request information which has
been posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles:

   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers
   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism
   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument
   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources

This is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The
others are entirely optional.

If you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers.  The articles titled ""A Primer on How to Work With
the Usenet Community"", ""Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet""
and ""Hints on writing style for Usenet"" are particularly relevant.  Questions

                                Finding Stuff

All of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are
some suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:

1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with
   ""Alt.Atheism FAQ:"".

2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.

   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up
   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
   problem.

3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.70.0.226].
   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest
   versions of the FAQ files there.

   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you
   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to
   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with

      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq

ra>   Robert, you keep making references to ""orthodox"" belief, and saying
ra> things like ""it is held that..."" (cf. ""Kermit"" thread).  On what
ra> exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call ""orthodox?""

     ""Orthodox"" is a compound word. It comes from 'orthos' (straight, true, 
     right) and from 'doxa' (opinion, doctrine, teaching). I use orthodox to 
     refer to 'right teaching.' Right teaching is derived from letting God 
     speak to us through the Bible. This can be from reading simple truths 
     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.

ra> Who is that ""holds that"" Luke meant what you said he meant?

     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are
     pertinent.

     Luke 23:43 records Christ's promise to the repentant thief who hung on
     an adjacent cross: ""Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in
     paradise."" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead
     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until
     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The
     answer lies in the location of ""paradise"" when Jesus died.

     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.

     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and 
     Lazarus as ""Abraham's Bosom,"" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was
     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus
     ""Abraham's Bosom"" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed
     waited till the day of Christ's Resurrection.

     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of 
     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith
     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven
     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or
     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with
     the Father.

     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the
     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But
     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene
     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then
     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise
     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in
     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: ""Ascending on high, He led captivity
     captive; He gave gifts unto men."" Verse 9 continues: ""But what does `He
     ascended' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the
     earth?"" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: ""He who descended is the same
     as He who ascended above all the heavens."" Presumably He led the whole
     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of
     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.

ra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is
ra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra> ""look at the Bible"" in order to see the truth, but what of those who
ra> see Biblical things differently from you?

     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my 'personal 
     interpretation' is questioned, I usually give a reason.

     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where
     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. 

     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one 
     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff 
     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can 
     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put 
     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to 
     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.

ra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra> understands it?

     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is 
     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply 
     stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from 
     Scripture and then we can go on.

"I'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in Z-buffering, that I've encountered in 2 different
PEX implementations.  I can't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins's
_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors' documentation).

I'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the
same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on
comp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,
hence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and
are interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in
comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach
to dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above
Gaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)

The problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize ""stitching""
artifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will
differ slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values
across an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area.  Because of this, it's a tossup whether the
Z-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.
Visually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid.

Using the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one
for the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The
result is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.

This shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair ""backwards"" (i.e.
smaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed
to NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.

I would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,
typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).
Therefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching.

But in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003
to 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it's worst when the NPC Z
component of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more
or less edge-on to the viewer.)  It's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the
Z-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines ""show through""
areas which they are supposed to lie behind.

I've observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital
workstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test
program demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;
this version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX
5.1.

Open questions:
    (1) Why does this happen?
        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?
        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines
            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which
            could be corrected for?
        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their
            interpolators?
        --  Something else?
    (2) What to do about it?
        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
            in Z-buffered HLHSR?
        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching
            artifacts?
        --  Am I just out of luck?

Any help would be immensely appreciated!

   . . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud.

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either.

What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""?
Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
least it was a good try...",2

Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.

That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the

That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to
fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,
there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.
 
Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.
 
 
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.

out of which they are usually derived. ""I exist"" is derived, if you want
it that way.
 
Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.

with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or
the way the world works.
 
 
 
Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make
B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating

So how much mass is saved by not burning the OMS?  That's the critical question.
My data shows that the OMS engines hold 10,900 kg of propellant.  Of that, a 
substantial fraction is going to be used for the first OMS burn, the reentry
burn and the reserve.  So Pat, tell us how much fuel the altitude change is
going to take, and how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1 and extra parts are going
mass.  If you can make the numbers work out, _then_ I'll be interested.  After
you show us that it can be done, then tell us how much the EDO pallet, BUS-1
and extra equipment is going to cost.  




First, while astronauts certainly have done EVAs with minimal planning, that was
because they _had_ to.  They don't like to do that as a general rule.

Second, remember why they had to improvise during Intelsat 6?  They were trying
to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn't designed to do that.  
Trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely.

Third, they don't have eight months.  They have however much time is left 
after someone comes up with a plan, shows it can work and gets it approved.
You may think I have a pessimistic attitude.  I think it's realistic.  I'm not
saying that the engineering task is impossible (few engineering tasks are).  
What I'm saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under NASA
management.



""All they have to do is soup it up?""  Just what does that mean?  




The second servicing mission is a contingency.  You have neither shown that it
would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your
plan.  


No, Pat, I haven't forgotten.


No Pat.  That's $500 million minus the cost of the new hardware, minus the cost
of the extra struff you want to bring along, minus development and mangement 
costs, minus extra operating costs.  TANSTAAFL.



I'm sure that if you reread this you'll see that your argument is falacious.


Pat, not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that's _made_ to 
perform this task, it also ignores the point.  There is a desire to have 
astronauts available so that if the door fails to open, something can be done
about it.  Unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door,
you haven't solved the problem.

we have no parallax measurements on the bursts.

super string  impacts or something like that.

I am afraid you are mis-directed. NeXTSTEP is an operating system as opposed to 
a package. I have read a little about it but since Steve Jobs does not seem to 
have the marketing capabilities of Bill Gates my info. is limited. Probably why
the far inferior Windows NT is going to be more widely distributed (but that
is another flame-ridden story). Some of the innovative features of NeXTSTEP are
binary compatibility across platforms (eg you can just copy your program from
a Sparc to a PC and it would run, as opposed to buying the version of the package
ported to a PC), graphical object-oriented design (its all WSIWIG postscript), 
supports parallel hetrogeneous processing, and best of all it is based around 
the Mach micro-kernel so you can make it look like Unix with X, or DOS, or NT or 
even VMS if you feel the need. No package out there comes even close. I hope 
people will subscribe to the HyperKnowledge project and NeXTSTEP finally
takes off in my lifetime :-)",2

Sure about that? Maybe Proxima might cause problems, but at Oort
Cloud distances AC a and AC b together look like a point source.

Besides, even the solar system's Oort cloud is unstable over

else, like the short period comets of the Kupier Belt?

Until we're able to perform a broad-band survey of nearby stars

I don't necessarily disagree with your assertion, but I disagree with

state why faith and dogma are dangerous.  

If you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in
Waco, you are missing the point.  

The Branch Davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the
messenger.  They believed Koresh was a prophet, and therefore believed
everything he said.  The problem wasn't the religion, it was the 
followers.  They didn't die because of faith and dogma, they died because
of their zealotry (or, in the case of the children, the zealotry of their
parents).

not make one totally irrational.  I think I know what you were getting at,
but I'd rather hear you expand on the subject.



Again, this statement is too general.  A Christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher, and absolutely capable of changing his/her mind.  Faith in
God is a belief, and all beliefs may change.  Would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
God which, of course, may show unfair bias when studying, say, religion?





So, Christianity is a prison, eh?  Ever heard of parole?  You have read far
too much into this subject.  A Christian is one who follows the religion
based on the teachings of a man named Jesus Christ.  Nowhere does this
definition imply that one cannot change one's mind.  In prison, however,
you can't just decide to leave.  One is voluntary, the other is not.  The
two are not compatible.



I prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8^)
Seriously, though, some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn
groups of people.  The common target is the ""infidel,"" a curious being
who is alternately an atheist, a non-<insert specific religious
affiliation here>, a person of a different race, or an Egyptian. 8^)

Please explain how ""just because"" thinking kills people.  (And please
state more in your answer than ""Waco."")



I'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious 
zealot with bad acne. 8^)  By the way, I wasn't aware mass suicide
was a problem.  Waco and Jonestown were isolated incidents.  
Mass suicides are far from common.

Tell that to the people who run the 10-meter Keck telescope, or the 
astronomers and engineers working on the Gemini twin 8-meter telescope
project.  It took 7 years to build Keck I and now they are building
Keck II.  According to the December 1992 Sky & Telescope, ""This
second 10-meter eye will convert the facility into a binocular telescope
with double the light-gathering power and the ability to resolve
the headlights of a car some 25,000 kilometers away.""   Japan's 8.3-meter
Subaru telescope will soon join Keck on Mauna Kea.  All these telescopes
will work in the infrared, yes, but they are _visible light_ telescopes!

And haven't you heard anything about adaptive optics?  A lot of research
was done with ""Star Wars"" funding, and some is now being shared with
astronomers.  This shows great promise.  Soon, probably within a few
years, even the largest telescopes will be able to resolve to their 
theoretical limit _despite_ the distortions of the atmosphere.

To say that ""visible light astronomy is already a dying field"" is 
pure hokum.  To use the ""logic"" that things are already bad, so it doesn't
matter if it gets worse is absurd.  Maybe common sense and logic
are the dying fields.

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They
still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate.

"People who criticize ""big Government"" and its projects rarely seem to
have a consistent view of the role of Government in science and
technology.  Basically, the U.S. Government has gotten into the role of
supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too
long-term.  

(Historically, this role for the U.S. Gov't was forced upon it because
of socialism in other countries.  In order for U.S.  industries to
compete with government-subsidized foreign competitors, the U.S. Gov't
has taken on the role of subisizing big-ticket or long-lead R&D.)

As a Republican, I abhor the necessity for our Government to involve
itself in technology this way.  I believe that market forces should
drive technology, and the world would be a better place for it.  But
the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously, or
some countries would have subsidized R&D, while others would not.  So
the U.S. must subsidize because everybody else does.  (This sounds a
lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our GATT negotiations,
doesn't it?)

But this role of Government subsidies is antithetical to
cost-effectiveness.  The general idea is to spend money on new
technology, and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture,
despite the forces in the business world (like the dreaded quarterly
earnings report) which erode the ability of U.S. industry to invest in
new technology.  And since our goal is to spend money, it makes little
sense to try to save money.

Of course, we could always spend our money more wisely, but EVERYBODY
disagrees about that the wisdom should be.  

It's interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control
available in industry today were derived from Government projects.
GANTT charts, CP/M, and most of the modern scheduling software comes
from DoD projects and their contractors.  The construction industry
has taken these tools to the core of their businesses; every large
construction project now uses these tools.

"Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one
or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see
an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something.

Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are
binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali
is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding ""transformation engines"".

The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation
and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.

may want.  Oh, some prices:

Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S.

First, you seem to assume all atheists think alike.  An atheist does not
believe in the existence of a god.  Our opinions on issues such as 
capital punishment and abortion, however, vary greatly.  

If you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (Benedikt, I 
presume), then please present your argument as such and do not lump us
all together.

As for the issues, let's start with abortion.  Personally, I do not support
abortion as a means of population control or contraception-after-the-fact.
However, I support the right of any woman to have an abortion, regardless
of what my personal views may be, because it would be arrogant of me to tell
any individual what he/she may or may not do to his/her body, and the domain
of legislators should not extend into the uterus.  That's my opinion, and I
am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.

I do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control, but I 
certainly defend it as an end to itself.  I think most homosexuals would
be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as
nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.  

As for atheists believing all values are biological, I have no idea what
you're talking about.

Finally, there are the issues of war and capital punishment.  An atheist
can object to either one just as easily as a theist might.  You seem to
be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and 
population control.  Could this be the ""atheist cause"" you were referring 
to a few posts back?

"Hello netters,

   I'm new to this board and I thought this might be the best place

watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS
was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at
night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,
one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.

"We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern

get round to it eventually.

The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,
with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke
the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap
forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with
primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose
with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
without coaling.

Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,
and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster
said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to
carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book ""How the World was One""

"I replied to this query via e-mail, but I think there are some
issues that are worth discussing in public.


I would recommend you to take a look at

1) your dictionary
2) alt.atheism FAQ files

to notice that atheism is _not_ a belief system, and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief, but a _lack of belief in deities_.
I cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue. 


IMHO, this is a poor method to do any real survey, although I'm sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours.


No, I do _not_ know what you mean. If you are surveying our individual
philosophies, fine, but that's not strictly atheism. Atheism is not
just another, godless version of the theistic explanations for life,
the universe and everything. It is not a belief system, and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system.

Once more: Atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities. 
Do not twist the meaning, or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on.

Some comments on your questions:


I would also like to hear more about this. Have we been able to 'convert'
anyone?


This question contains a contradiction in terms. _Beliefs_ 
cannot be acquired rationally - if they could, they would not be 
beliefs! You also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists - those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists, they just think very little about religion. It seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.

Those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd - how can lack of belief be acquired? When did I acquire
lack of belief in the Easter Bunny? (I did believe in Santa, though ;-))


This question does not make any sense, since atheism does not deal with
these issues - it is not a worldview, or a philosophy, or a belief system.

Sigh, why haven't I seen a good, well-thought survey in the Usenet
for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net,
anyway? Just to abstract some opinions?

helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on
Mount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak
without oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because
if you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably
pass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So
this is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be
limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher
pressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and
could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the
bends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of
pressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in
front of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes
toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen
narcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like
taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet
under water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I
am not a diving expert).

Mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere
is too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,
the Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a 
pressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?",2

Why?  Your last statement.  Why?  By which authority?

Why?  Your last statement.  Why are these things necessary?  

And believe me, a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly

Trouble is, this would sound just fine coming from someone like Hitler, too.

Mike,

I've seen referrences to ""Creation vs Evolution"" several times in a.a
and I have question. Is either point of view derived from direct
observation; can either be scientific? I wonder if the whole
controversy is more concerned with the consequences of the ""Truth""
rather than the truth itself. 
Both sides seem to hold to a philosophical outcome, and I can't help
wondering which came first. As I've pointed out elsewhere, my view of
human nature makes me believe that there is no way of knowing
anyhthing objectively - all knowledge is inherently subjective. So, in
the context of a.a, would you take a stand based on what you actually
know to be true or on what you want to be true and how can you tell
the difference?",0

Why would the NT NOT be considered a good source.  This might be a 
literary/historical question, but when I studied history I always looked for 
firsthand original sources to write my papers.  If the topic was on Mr. X, I 
looked to see if Mr. X wrote anything about it.  If the topic was on a group, 
look for the group, etc.  If the topic is on Mr. X, and Mr. X did not write 
anything about it, (barring the theistic response about the Bible being 
divinely inspired which I can't adequately argue), wouldn't we look for people
who ate, worked, walked, talked, etc. with him?  If someone was at an event 
wouldn't they be a better ""reporter"" than someone who heard about it second

Non-religious reasons for having a ""moment of silence"" for a dead

"molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a  international  industry. Computer  graphics has played  a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build, visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.
 
While computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline, they are often unfamiliar with the terminology,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
Similarly, chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.
 
This interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. Although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design, data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. Lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data-flow programming
(IBM Visualization Data Explorer software) and students will have
access to Cornell Theory Center computing resources, including video
recording equipment.
 
Audience:  researchers and students in the chemical and biological
           sciences interested in integrating state-of-the-art
           computer graphics into their research; computer scientists
           wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
           scientific visualization.
 
           The class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
           first-come first-served basis.
 
Level:     Graduate/advanced undergraduate, 1 or 2 Credits. May be taken
           without credit as a workshop. Calculus, linear algebra
           and introductory chemistry required. Familiarity with Unix,
           X-windows and C is useful but not required.
 
Date:   June 14-25, 1993  (2 Credits)
        June 14-18, 1993  (1 or 0 credits)

Cost:   0 or 1 credit       $410
        2 credits           $820
 
Format
 
The course will be held in the Theory Center training facility
where computer workstations will be available.  Daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. Students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. Those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures, be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.
 
Content (may vary)
 
    Elements of computer graphics
         polygonal rendering, lighting models, ray tracing, volumetric
         rendering, stereo graphics, animation, introduction to data-flow

"A bright light phenomenon was observed in the Eastern Finland
    on April 21. At 00.25 UT two people saw a bright, luminous
    pillar-shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near
    Mikkeli. The head of the pillar was circular. The lower part
    was a little winding. It was like a monster they told. They
    were little frightened. Soon the yellowish pillar became
    enlarged. A bright spot like the Sun was appeared in the middle
    of the phenomenon. At last the light landed behind the nearby
    forest. Now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were
    visible till morning sunrise.

    The same phenomenon was observed also by Jaakko Kokkonen in
    Lappeenranta. At 00.26 UT he saw a luminous yellowish trail in
    the low northeastern horizont. The altitude of the trail was
    only about 3-4 degrees. Soon the trail began to grow taller.
    A loop was appeared in the head of the trail. It was like a
    spoon. This lasted only 10 seconds. Now the altitude was about
    five degress above horizont. He noted a bright spot at the
    upper stage of loop. The spot was at magnitude -2. The loop
    became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of
    the loop. A cartwheel-shaped trail was appeared round the bright
    spot. After a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails
    were only visible in the low horizont. Luminous trails were still
    visible at 01.45 UT in the morning sky.

    The phenomenon was caused by a Russian rocket. I don't know if
    there were satellite launches in Plesetsk Cosmodrome near
    Arkhangelsk, but this may be a rocket experiment too. Since 1969
    we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in Finland. Most of

    experiments and other chemical releases. During these years we
    have observed 17 satellite launches.

   This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
   anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
   as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
   That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
   to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
   known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
   are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

Merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right
energy, except it doesn't explain why there is no apparent correlation
with galaxies or galaxy structure, there is no mechanism for getting
all the energy out in gamma rays (with any significant amount of
baryons around there will be a lot of pair production, which makes a
plasma, which thermalizes the energy), it has trouble generating
enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts (10^52-53 ergs), it
happens too fast compared to the burst duration, and it is hard to
make tight-binaries of neutron stars.

Another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a
neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars, but
that uses pretty far-out physics.

My point is that we don't have a good mechanism at any distance, so
GRB's are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism, so we can't
rule out the Oort cloud.  What would be the spectrum of an event which
converts a comet to strange matter?  The spectra for primordial black
holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets
aren't quite right, but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which
modifies the spectrum.  The energy matches very well for both of these
mechanisms.  According to Trevor Weeks, if the ""Tunguska Meteorite""
was a mini-black hole collision with the earth, then there are likely
to be enough mini-black holes around that the rate for BH-comet
collisions matches the GRB rate well.

The fact that we don't know the distribution of comets in the Oort
cloud isn't a reason to rule them out; it makes it harder to rule them
out.  The point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the
right distribution for the Oort cloud, it is hard but not impossible
to match that up with the distribution of GRB's.  If they got the
wrong distribution for the Oort cloud, they can't constrain any Oort-
cloud GRB's at all.",2

Exactly...

I didn't want to mess with tga or rle.  So I wrote the following script. 
All you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities. 

This script is a .pov to .jpg converter.  Just run it like this:

  pov2jpg 1280 1024 fred.pov 

You will need to modify the path's in the script to reflect where you put
povray and its include files.  If you have a problem with disk space, you
can use named pipes instead of temporary files.

I hope you find it useful...

": >Why not build a inflatable space dock.

: If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in
: a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense.  The question is whether
: anyone is going to be doing large-scale satellite servicing in the near
: future, to the point of justifying development of such a thing.

That's a mighty fine idea.  But since you asked ""Why not,"" I'll
respond.

Putting aside the application of such a space dock, there are other
factors to consider than just pressurized volume.  Temperature control
is difficult in space, and your inflatable hangar will have to 
incorporate thermal insulation (maybe a double-walled inflatable).
Micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required.
Don't think this will be a clear plastic bubble; it's more likely
to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi-layer
fabric that soft-torso space suits are made out of today.

Because almost all manned space vessels (Skylab, Mir, Salyut) used
their pressurization for increased structural rigidity, even though
they had (have) metal skins, they still kind of qualify as inflatable.

The inflation process would have to be carefully controlled.  The
space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials (due to
temperature extremes, monotomic Oxygen impingement, and radiation
effects on materials), so your ""fabric"" may not retain any flexibility
for long.  (This may not matter.)  Even after inflation, pressure
changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric, which could
lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases.

These are some of the technical difficulties which the LLNL proposal
for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of
success.

Rome was under attack by barbarians, they sent for advice to some Oracle,
and she said Worship Cybele and you'll be saved. They did, they were.

Cybele was the quintessential wiccan goddess, there was Her and her son &
lover, Attis. Yucky idea if you ask me. OK the book says she was Phrygian,
from the neolithic matriarchal society Catal Huyuk (Turkey). Worshipped 1st
as Black Stone (that Kaaba in Mecca ring a bell maybe????) Carried to Rome
in 205BC to save them from Hannibal.

It gets more interesting. Romans called her Great Mother (Magna Mater),
could be the reason why so many of those Mary statues in Europe are black,
prob. IS connected to that Ka'aba they've got in Mecca, 3rd cent. AD She was
supreme Goddess in Lyons, France . . . Attis was castrated and formed into
a pine tree . . . she should be worshiped on 25 Mar . . . in Rome it was
an ecstatic cult, her priests wore drag, worked themselves up in dance and
castrated themselves in order to initiate to her, lived their lives as women.
They wore make up and jewelry and the whole bit.

Wow.

Only other such primitive transsexualism I know of goes on in India (where
else?) where they do that castration thing under some meditation maybe, I
forget by now...there's a book on that.)

Of course, that excepts that weird Russian / Romanian 18th cent. Xian cult

"[ There are actually some talk.abortion related comments below, believe it or
  not... ]


Well, if our observer X is as likely to be in A's position as B's, and if he
agrees that both A and B are making appropriate observations and inferences
regarding the situation, then I would expect him to conclude that there is no
right answer.  Hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow
him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.

If, on the other hand, he disagrees with the principles of either A or B, I
suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.

It is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from
all perspectives.  For instance, I am completely unable to come to any
conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not, from my
perspective.  In an ideal world, all living things would have a right to
life; but in an ideal world, women would have the absolute right to do what
they like with their own bodies.  Clearly there is no way to resolve in
favour of both these principles.  Therefore I agree with the compromise
solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception, and
deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill-defined) criteria.  This
is also a sensible move, I think, because it lets people make their own
decisions (within reason).  And for what it's worth, I am reasonably happy
with current UK abortion law.

Similarly, the situation in what's left of Yugoslavia is a horrible mess, and
I really can't see my way to any sort of conclusion.  There, I don't even
know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.

This is a good question.  There are major blind spots in our understanding
of what makes the earth habitable.  For example, why does the earth's
atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does?  The naive
answer is ""photosynthesis"", but this is clearly incomplete.  Photosynthesis
by itself can't make the atmosphere oxygenated, as the oxygen produced
is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten.  What is needed
is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of
the resulting reduced material.

On earth, this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic
matter, mostly from oceanic sources.  However, this burial requires
continental sediments (in the deep ocean, the burial rate is so slow
that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered).

This suggests that a planet without large oceans, or a planet without
continents undergoing weathering, will have a hard time accumulating
an oxygen atmosphere.  In particular, an all-ocean planet may have a
hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere.

There is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth's atmosphere
has been relatively stable over geological time, for a period at least
2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric O2 to
weathering in the absence of replenishment.  No convincing feedback
mechanism has been identified.  Perhaps the reason is the weak
anthropic principle: if during the last 500 MYr or so, the oxygen
level had dropped too low, we wouldn't be here to be wondering about
it.",2

Perhaps all of us hackers have become (ICK) PROFESSIONALS?  I have noticed
my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.
It is rather distasteful.  It occurs when a series of things happen:

   1) one's ego outgrows one's talent/knowledge
   2) one's financial situation takes precedence
   3) A change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)
   4) the hacker's attitude makes the shift from ""fun"" to ""work""
   5) one's vocation burns away the creativity needed for ""the hobby""

or the biggest killer (IMO)

   6) one's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society's
      version of reality.  Without the dream the motivation dies, without
      the motivation the effort seems useless.

Another set of problems stems from our children.  While most of us remember
when there were several completely different computer systems, our children
are growing up with just a few choices (MSDOS/Mac/Amiga) and do not enjoy
the diversity we did.  I remember the great computer fallout of the early
eighties vividly as I was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
that were now dead.  The diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
divergent paradigms.  That period forced hackers to continually learn new
systems in the attempt to keep up.  Not to mention that if a program was
needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a
commercial offering was just not available.  Now our children are being
taught the ""user"" mentality.  As the number of us ""old-timers"" dwindle we are
not being replaced by the next generation.

I have never said that only humans are the only beings which are
sufficiently sentient to have intentions.   In fact, I have explicitly
said that I am perfectly happy to consider that some animals *are*
capable of forming intentions.

What I am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive
behaviour to have moral significance, since, it seems to me, 
such behaviour does *not* involve intention.


That's not the point.   The point is whether the implementor thinks
*at all*.    The issue is not whether thinking produces opinion A
or opinion B, but whether thinking takes place, period.


Since humans are part of nature, are not all human actions ""natural"".

Or perhaps you're going to throw in a definition of ""natural"" that
will allow us to describe some actions as ""natural"" and some as 
""not natural"".   If so, what is the definition?

Obviously, we have different sources. Bill Moyers (who happens to be a
theist, to tie this to alt.atheism!) in his PBS documentary ""After The
War"" is my main source. (I think I still have it on videotape.) Others
include The Nation and The Progressive.

The rest of the article is mere rationalisation. You may claim that
sanitation plants are strategic ""legitimate"" targets, but what happens to
the civilians in a city with no sewer system? What happens to the
civilians when you destroy water purification plants? And when hospitals
can't handle the resultant epidemics, because there is no more electricity?

And what exactly are your sources? We have all, I'm sure, seen Postol's
interviews in the media where he demostrates how the Pentagon lied about
the Patriot's effectiveness; what is your source for the 70%
effectiveness you claim?

In any case, I don't know if this is relevant to alt.atheism. How about

Hmm... 48 bit aye?
Well, it beats a 32-bit design for thee sake of ellegance.
48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.
The 2^48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. It makes more sense to see it
as 65536 possible shades of pure red.
This might actually make some sense, since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours)

Okay, I see smilies, so this isn't supposed to be a serious post.
On the other hand, I would suppose it does has some motivation behind

statement is worthless. Presuming the Qur'an is a perfect religious 
text (whatever that might be) there is still plenty of room for 
disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.

I've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
between two people who in fact _do_ disagree about Islam, which doesn't
presume anything about the Qur'an other than its having sufficient
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of
Islam. This hardly constitutes a claim that no two people could have
disagreements about _all_ issues relevant to Islam.

with what the Bible teaches in relating his own experience with God,

causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming
convinced that God exists and that he needs to be reconciled to God.

I'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to

Apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism; I think
many of these are well addressed in the famous FAQ.  Your generalisms
are then misplaced -- atheism needn't imply materialism, or the lack
of an absolute moral system.  However, I do tend to materialism and
don't believe in absolute morality, so I'll answer your questions.


An atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does: according
to a personal understanding of morality.  That I don't believe in an
absolute one doesn't mean that I don't have one.  I'm just explicit,
as in the line of postings you followed up, that when I express
judgment on a moral issue I am basing my judgment on my own code
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.
My moral code is not particular different from that of others around
me, be they Christians, Muslims, or atheists.  So when I say that I
object to genocide, I'm not expressing anything particularly out of
line with what my society holds.

If your were to ask why I think morality exists and has the form it
does, my answer would be mechanistic to your taste -- that a moral
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society, and that humanity
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of
our ability to exist in large societies, thereby achieving
considerable survival advantages.  You'd probably say that God just
made the rules.  Neither of us can convince the other, but we share a
common understanding about many moral issues.  You think you get it
from your religion, I think I get it (and you get it) from early
childhood teaching.


I think you've been reading the wrong sort of comic books, but in
prying through the gobbledygook I basically agree with what you're
saying.  I do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as ""God
commanded the genocide of the Canaanites"" is mechanistic, but of
course I think that's true of you as well.  My reaction has little to
do with whether God exists or even with whether I think he does, but
if a god existed who commanded genocide, I could not consider him
good, which is supposedly an attribute of God.


Hmm.  Yes, I think some heavy FAQ-reading would do you some good.  I
have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person.  In
fact, I can actually accomplish something in such a discussion, by
framing the questions in terms of reason: for instance, it is clear
that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt
to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands, then the
quality of life will be generally poor, so a system that fosters
coexistence is superior, if quality of life is an agreed goal.  An
absolutist, on the other hand, can only thump those portions of a
Bible they happen to agree with, and say ""this is good"", even if the
act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in
the discussion.  The attempt to define someone or a group of people as
""excluded from discussion"", such that they ""cannot participate"", and
their opinions given ""no weight whatsoever"" is the lowest form or
reasoning (ad hominem/poisoning the well), and presumably the resort
of someone who can't rationally defend their own ideas of right,
wrong, and the Bible.

Over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and
elsewhere on the net.  Generally, the discussion comes down to the
contention on the one hand that TSV contains such blood libel against
Islam as to merit, if not death, than at least banning and probably
some sort of punishment; and on the other that Rushdie, particularly
as a non-muslim in a Western country, had every right to write and
publish whatever he chose, regardless of whether some muslims find it
offensive, without fear of persecution or death.  

I am naturally inclined to the latter position, but find myself in an
interesting position, because I think this is a fine book, only
incidentally concerned with Islam, and moreover I'm damned if I can
find anything malevolently offensive in it.

Over the years, when I have made this point, various primarily muslim
posters have responded, saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as ""filth and lies"", ""I would rank
Rushdie's book with Hitler's Mein Kempf or worse"", and so on.
Unfortunately, these comments are usually generalities, and attempts
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so
offensive have met either with stony silence, more generalizations, or
inaccurate or out-of-context references to the book [which lead me to
believe that few of them have actually read it].  Corrections and
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.

Anyway, since I seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion, I wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book?  What are your thoughts on it?

There are several problems here. First, you are discussing only
experimental procedures. Observational procedures are also useful.  The
main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make
prediction about as-yet unmade observations. The observations could be
the result of an experiment, or they could be obsevations of activity
occuring spontaneossly in nature, or they could even be observations of
the lasting results of events long past. All that matters is that the
observations be *new*.  This is what prediction is about in science -
it is
*not* about predicting the future except in this very restricted
sense.

Secondly, repeatability can also take many forms.  It is really just
the
requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.
The
observation of a fossil is 'repeatable', since any qualified observer
may
look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum).  Also,
there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will
correspond
to the current one.  New fossils are found often enough that this is
tested regularly.  Many times a new fossil actually falsifies some
conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.

Unfortunately for you, the models that were falsified have alway been
peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  (For instance, the
front legs of Tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles,
rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).

So, in fact, histoircal science findings *are* repeatable in the
necessary sense.  Just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the
original
event does *not* make it impossible to make valid observations.

[This is not to say that biologists would not go coo-coo if extra-
terrestrial life were discovered - that could make the determination
of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy].

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

XV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other
image formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),
file contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you'll get
only 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works
fine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a
glitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the ""save at normal size"" checkbox
when saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip
    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip
    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,
    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has
    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

For monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level
grayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.

I have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for
Ataris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.

NeXT:

ImageViewer is a PD utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions.  The current version reads JPEG but does not write it.
ImageViewer is available from the standard NeXT archives at
sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu, somewhere in /pub/next (both are
currently being re-organized, so it's hard to point to specific
sub-directories).  Note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support JPEG.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

I had an ehum, interesting experience with the Rosicrucians, or at
least Rosicrucians of some sort last Sunday. They had advertised that
they were holding a lecture titled The Graal of the King -- the room
of the heart (which rhymes in Swedish). Out of curiosity, I went to
the lecture.

There were four people there apart from the two Rosicrucians, one
woman and two men apart from me. The Rosicrucians were male, both of
them. First one of them told us about the Rosicrucians and Lectorium
Rosicrucianum, which was founded in Harlem, NL in 1925. He read
straight from a piece of paper, which I at that point was because he
lacked experience in talking in front of people, but the other guy
read, too, and he was used to holding speeches, I could tell. The
first guy also said that the R:s are a mystical Christian order, and
that they base their teachings on the teachings of the Kathars
(English?) from the thirteenth century.

The other guy took over, reading from his piece of paper in a
fairy-tale teller's voice. What he said sounded like a load of crap to
me. Of course that might be because I am unenlightened or something.
What made me a bit suspicious, was the way they first said that we all
contained something divine, and could find our way back to divinity,
then that we couldn't become divine as the persons we are currently,
but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. Maybe I've
read too much RAW, but it sounded very much like the things he talks
about in the chapter _How to robotize people and brainwash your
friends_ in _Prometheus rising_. 

It was very interesting to watch the two Rosicrucians. The one holding
the actual lecture, obviously was top dog, and the other one seemed to
be a true believer. I got the impression that the top dog had more
distance to the faith than the true believer, that he used it to gain
power and admiration. He spoke like a fairy-tale teller, whenever he
remembered. ;)

you discuss it politely.  this means that the motive behind the conversation
is not only your self-gratifying wish to spread the word.  

religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person, and
reflects their value judgements.  Religion is something that is

Indeed, the sky doesn't look much like a black body if you look carefully
enough; in particular, its temperature at radio frequencies is quite a
bit higher than you would see from a black body.  Morgan&Gordon's fat
""Communications Satellite Handbook"" has a graph of sky temperature vs.
wavelength, in fact, for communications design.

However, in terms of energy content, the RF frequencies are negligible.
For thermal purposes, at very large distances from the Sun the sky
looks like a black body at 3.5K (Allen, ""Astrophysical Quantities"").
I haven't found a number for non-large distances, since solar radiation
tends to be something you can't just ignore :-), but M&G says ""about 4K""

Hmm.  The police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn, clearly marked as
officers and yelling ""Police"" repeatedly.  This is used every day to bust drug
houses.  The idea is to awe the suspects into submission with surprise and
display of firepowere in order to avoid a gun fight.  As for not knocking, it's
a sad necessity in many cases since the suspects will attempt to escape or even
fight.  Usually this strategy works; if it didn't, then it wouldn't be used so
commonly, now would it?

Whether or not it was appropriate to use this strategy on the BD is not my
point, since I don't think any of us have enough information to make a clear
judgement on this issue.

I merely point out that it IS a valid strategy which is used every day.
Furthermore, we don't know of any substitute strategy capable of apprehending
potentially dangerous and armed suspects.  Do you suggest that the police
always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any suspects until they have
been allowed to inspect the officers's badges?  Just what should the police do
when apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects?  How far can they
reasonably go to identiy themselves?  What do you suggest they can do which
can't be faked by the ""competition""?

Even if you've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops, that's not an
excuse to murder police.  In the case of the BD's, there was almost definitely

PHILIP K. DICK

Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short 
stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable.
He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than
technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he
remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:

""Galactic Pot-Healer""
A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is
unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.

""A Maze of Death""
Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.

""VALIS""
The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic
Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

""The Divine Invasion""
God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.

MARGARET ATWOOD

""The Handmaid's Tale""
A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously
assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live
under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked,
and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the
radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished
retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are
hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

VARIOUS AUTHORS

""The Bible""
This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it
is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is
about.  It exists in many different versions, so make sure you get the one
true version.

existence of god(s)"") and also for ""positive atheism"" (""the belief in the
non-existence of god(s)"").  Includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god; particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as Platinga and Swinburne.

""Without God, Without Creed"", The Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore,
 MD, USA
Subtitled ""The Origins of Unbelief in America"".  Examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic)  became a mainstream alternative
world-view.  Focusses on the period 1770-1900, and while considering France
and Britain the emphasis is on American, and particularly New England
developments.  ""Neither a religious history of secularization or atheism,
Without God, Without Creed is, rather, the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea, the belief that God exists.""

RICHARD SWINBURNE

""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford
This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of
Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this
work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and
aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were
decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised
edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.

J. L. MACKIE

""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford
This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through
the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those
positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,
such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for
God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less
formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.

"Regarding the feasability of retrieving the HST for repair and
relaunching it:

(Caution: speculation mode engaged)
There is another consideration that hasn't been mentioned yet.
I expect that retrieving HST would involve 'damaging' it considerably in
order to return it to its cradle in the cargo bay.  Most of the deployed
items (antennas and, especially, the solar arays) probably are not
retractable into their fully stowed position, even by hand.  They would
have to be removed by the astronauts.  (The only advantage that this
might yield is that we could put new panels on that don't 'ring' due
to thermal cycle stresses...)

I also expect that, as has been discussed, the landing loads on the
HST optics structure is a big issue (but that the reentry loads are
much less so.)  Can the moveable optical components even be re-caged
(I assume that they were caged for launch)?

Well, let me see if I can explain it.  It's similar to collecting coins,
or stamps, or campaign buttons, or coke bottles, or juke boxes, or model
trains, or just about anything else that is collected (and just about
everything is collected).  In all cases, you might consider it something
of an aberration; I mean, what purpose does it serve?  Not much really;
it's just a hobby.  The collector yearns for diversity (not much use in
having TWO of the same thing, except for trading/selling it), historical
significance (this was the thingy used by so-and-so), technical significance
(this is the only one that does such-and-such like this; this is the first
one to do it this way), rarity, and so on.

Some people use their collections, other people do not.  As you state, you
use your collection.  In one sense, this diminishes the value of your
collection as the items suffer wear and exposure.  In another sense, it
can enhance your own enjoyment of your collection.  Some people collect
firearms that they do not use; other people use some or all of the firearms
they collect.  It's just personal preference.

Bill, I think you have a misunderstanding about atheism. Lack of 
belief in God does not directly imply lack of understanding
transcendental values. I hope you would accept the fact that 
for instance Buddhists appreciate issues related to non-empirical
reasoning without the need to automatically believe in theism.

I think reading a couple of books related to Buddhism might 
revise and fine tune your understanding of non-Christian systems.

"Please help.

I have an IBM-compatible notebook computer with an LCD VGA screen.  While I
was working with it this morning, the screen started to flicker a little,
which I thought was odd since I do use a surge-protector for my computer and
all peripherals.  It only did this for a second and then stopped.

I left the room for several minutes and, when I returned, the screen was
completely dim, not blank, but very very dim.  The contrast slider still
worked so that I could adjust it to where I could *faintly* make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely *no* effect.

I was plugged-in at the time (i.e., not using the battery) but I still
tried switching the battery, changing the power-saver features, etc., etc.,
all to no avail.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this?  If this just means that I
need to replace the screen then I guess I'll have to but I thought that the
""death"" of my LCD screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened.  I didn't want to take it in to be repaired before I asked on the
net about this because I already know what they'll say: ""Yep, you gotta have
this replaced and it's gonna cost you $???.""

I've only had the computer for about 21 months.  Is that a reasonable life
cycle for a LCD display?  Oh, I guess I ought to give specifics here: the
brand is Compudyne (Is this a reputable company?), it's a 386SX @ 20 MHz.
I forget the model number exactly and I was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today.

If anyone can help me, PLEASE give me any advice you might have.  I'm not
opposed to having it replaced, but I'd rather not if it's not absolutely
necessary.  If you wouldn't mind, please e-mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu

Not useful unless you've got some truly wonderful propulsion system for

better to simply launch the probes independently.  The outer planets
are scattered widely across a two-dimensional solar system, and going
to one is seldom helpful in going to the next one.  Uranus is *not* on

Why shouldn't I mind? It sounds as if you are proceeding with just
the sort of obfuscation you have accused me of. I always preceeded
my statements with ""it is my understanding that..."" Now, I have made
my claim clear with regard to the issue of both the Twelve Imams and 
with Khomeini's supposed claim of infalibility. After hearing your
seemingly more knowledgable claim that Khomeini made no such claim
regarding himself, I have withdrawn that portion of my statement
regarding that claim. However, I have received _no_ such response
regarding the infallibility of the Twelve Imams. There is nothing
obfuscationist about my claims, which are always made clearly.
 
I have received no such clear response regarding the Twelve Imams
but rather abstruse references to unusual metaphysical natures and 
other such opaque ""concepts"" often used by people to camoflage the 
baselessness of their positions, particularly in matters of theology.

That's fascinating.  I take it that you're expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the Constitution of the people who stole their continent.  You
could be right, but it sounds plausible to me.  Is there any
reason that you dismiss it out-of-hand?  Here's some more:

   Recent scholarship has shown that in the mid-1700s Indians were not
   only invited to participate in the deliberations of our ""founding
   fathers,"" but that the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy
   arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 Albany
   Plan of Union, and later the Articles of Confederation and the
   Constitution.  That this would be absent from our school texts,
   and from history, and from media is not surprising given the devotion
   Americans feel to our founding myth: Great men gathered to express
   a new vision that has withstood the test of time.  If it were
   revealed that Indians had a role in it, imagine the blow to the
   American psyche.
   ...
      By 1754, when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
   Albany Plan of Union, the first try at confederation, they invited
   forty-two members of the Iroquois Grand Council to serve as advisors
   on confederate structures.  Benjamin Franklin freely acknowledged
   his interest in the Iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
   Albany Congress: ""It would be a strange thing...if six nations
   of ignorant savages[sic] should be capable of forming such a union
   and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
   for ages and appears indissoluble, and yet that a like union should
   be impractical for ten or a dozen English colonies.""
      According to Grinde, Franklin convened meetings of Iroquois chiefs
   and congressional delegates in order to ""hammer out a plan that he
   acknowedged to be similar to the Iroquois Confederacy.""

Grinde is Professor Donald Grinde,Jr., of the University of California
at Riverside whose book _The Iroquois and the Founding Fathers of the
American Nation_ addresses this issue.",0

Thank you, Steve.  It is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a Christian.  I only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction.  I am not certain what you mean by the ""fundy"" part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses.  If you refer to
those who actually believe Jesus is the Messiah and Son of God and
wish to follow in his way, then I plead guilty.  But what does it
matter what I think.  The Roman circus is over.  The lions have been
satisfied -- for now.  The Emperor, after the long and gruelling
struggle, sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.

With respect to my previous comments about David Koresh, I urge you
to re-examine my previous posts.  I believe you mistakenly assume
that defense of Koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his
right to express them to others implies agreement with Koresh'
theology.  Actually I understand little about the details of Branch-
Davidian teachings and regret so many are hung-up on that aspect
of the tragic events of the past few days.

Nor do I think Koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the
federal government.  Of course Hillary says he had been molesting
infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not
fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government; they are
state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the
local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having
ever been levied against him.  Under American law, he was innocent
as Americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty.  At least
that's how it is suppposed to be.  But he was demonized and propa-
gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a
lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might
bring upon him.  

But evidence trickles in that the twenty-one children, who left the
building in the early days of the siege,  were carefully examined
by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse
and none was found.  DeGuerin, one of the attorneys who met with
Davidians several times before the conflagration, reported that
the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.

Ultimately, Steve, what I think about the heart of David Koresh
is quite unimportant.  Today he is in the benevolent hands of a
most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.
So I withhold any judgment of David Koresh and defer to the One
who has all knowledge.  Meanwhile, let's clean up the mess left
on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong
message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the
people it serves.

part of the person making it.
 
 
Pretty perceptive, that Prof. Flew.
 
 
 
Please explain how this helps.  I don't see your argument.
 
 
 
This makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the
objectivist winds up, not the subjectivist.  Furthermore, the nihilists
believed in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the
People.

If you've got a good propulsion system that's not useful for deceleration,
sure you can use chemical rockets for that part... but even just doing the
deceleration chemically is a major headache.  We're talking seriously high
cruising velocities; taking the velocity down nearly to zero for a Pluto
orbit isn't easy with chemical fuels.

Incidentally, solar sails are not going to be suitable as the acceleration
system for something like this.  They don't go anywhere quickly.  (I speak
as head of mission planning for the Canadian Solar Sail Project, although
that is more or less an honorary title right now because CSSP is dormant.)
They can't fly a mission like this unless you start talking about very
advanced systems that drop in very close to the Sun first.",2

You don't *need* to, but it's desirable.  HST, like all satellites in
low Earth orbit, is gradually losing altitude due to air drag.  It was
deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach, for that reason.
It needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter.  (It has
no propulsion system of its own.)  This is an excellent opportunity,
given that there may not be another visit for several years.",2

Howdy...  I think you would be interested in Infini-D 2.5 for the Mac.  There
is no DOS or Windows version.  It's quite an amazing program.

""Some"" of the features:

*  Bevel Text
*  Timeline based animation sequencer
*  Realtime bounding box preview
*  Object linking
*  Phong Shading
*  Ray Tracing
*  Bounding Box shading
*  Wireframe shading
*  Ghourad shading
*  Flat shading
*  Anti-aliasing (none, low, medium, high)
*  Environment maps
*  Quicktime support (wrap a QT movie around an object)
*  Procedural surfaces
*  Composed surfaces (for layering surfaces)
*  Alpha channel support
*  Import EPS, DXF, and Swivel 3D files
*  Export DXF and Swivel 3D files
*  Spline based animation
*  Animation assistant (for creating smooth movements and other stuff)
*  Object morphing (surfaces and bevels morph too)

... And lots more that I can't remember right now...

Anyway, it's not as expensive as some of the other animation/rendering
packages.  I think you can get it for around $699 from MacWarehouse.
They also have educational discounts...

Correction, and some more info: The Kaliningrad that Mr. Larrison
writes about is indeed near Moscow. I've read that it may also be known by
the name Podlipk, and is a short distance from Zvezdny Gorodok (Star

Enterprise was also responsible for creating the NKIK (Ground Command and

"FREE-ENERGY TECHNOLOGY
                       by Robert E. McElwaine, Physicist
          
               Ninety to a hundred years ago, everybody ""knew"" that a 
          heavier-than-air machine could not possibly fly.  It would 
          violate the ""laws"" of physics.  All of the ""experts"" and 
          ""authorities"" said so. 
          
               For example, Simon Newcomb declared in 1901:  ""The 
          demonstration that no possible combination of known 
          substances, known forms of machinery and known forms of 
          force, can be united in a practical machine by which man 
          shall fly long distances through the air, seems to the writer 
          as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any 
          physical fact to be."" 
          
               Fortunately, a few SMART people such as the Wright 
          Brothers did NOT accept such pronouncements as the final 
          word.  Now we take airplanes for granted, (except when they 
          crash). 
          
               Today, orthodox physicists and other ""scientists"" are 
          saying similar things against several kinds of 'Free Energy' 
          Technologies, using negative terms such as ""pseudo-science"" 
          and ""perpetual motion"", and citing so-called ""laws"" which 
          assert that ""energy cannot be created or destroyed"" (""1st law 
          of thermodynamics"") and ""there is always a decrease in useful 
          energy"" (""2nd law of thermodynamics"").  The physicists do not 
          know how to do certain things, so they ARROGANTLY declare 
          that those things cannot be done.  Such PRINCIPLES OF 
          IMPOTENCE are COMMON in orthodox modern ""science"" and help to 
          cover up INCONSISTENCIES and CONTRADICTIONS in orthodox 
          modern theories. 
          
               Free Energy Inventions are devices which can tap a 
          seemingly UNLIMITED supply of energy from the universe, with-
          OUT burning any kind of fuel, making them the PERFECT 
          SOLUTION to the world-wide energy crisis and its associated 
          pollution, degradation, and depletion of the environment. 
          
               Most Free Energy Devices probably do not create energy, 
          but rather tap into EXISTING natural energy sources by 
          various forms of induction.  UNLIKE solar or wind devices, 
          they need little or no energy storage capacity, because they 
          can tap as much energy as needed WHEN needed.  Solar energy 
          has the DIS-advantage that the sun is often blocked by 
          clouds, trees, buildings, or the earth itself, or is reduced 
          by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and 
          high latitudes.  Likewise, wind speed is WIDELY VARIABLE and 
          often non-existent.  Neither solar nor wind power are 
          suitable to directly power cars and airplanes.  Properly 
          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. 
          
               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, 
          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for 
          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly 
          tapping into energy circulating through the earth's magnetic 
          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to 
          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in 
          ""Science & Mechanics"" magazine, Spring 1980, (""Amazing 
          Magnet-Powered Motor"", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, 
          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, 
          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such 
          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible 
          heatpump in one's home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.  [Complete

               A second type of free-energy device, such as the 'Gray 
          Motor' (U.S. Patent #3,890,548), the 'Tesla Coil', and the 
          motor of inventor Joseph Newman [see SCIENCE, 2-10-84, pages 
          571-2.], taps ELECTRO-MAGNETIC energy by INDUCTION from 
          'EARTH RESONANCE' (about 12 cycles per second plus 
          harmonics).  They typically have a 'SPARK GAP' in the circuit 
          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the 
          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total 
          'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the Device combine to 
          'RESONATE' at the same frequency as 'EARTH RESONANCE' in 
          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be 
          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the 'NEUTRAL CENTER' 
          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a 
          Tesla Coil, slipping a 'TOROID CHOKE COIL' around the 
          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [""Earth Energy: 
          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems"", by John Bigelow, 1976, 
          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] 
          
               During the 1930's, an Austrian civil engineer named 
          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an 
          'IMPLOSION TURBINE' (German name, 'ZOKWENDLE'), after 
          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped 
          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical 
          equations to explain it.  As described in the book ""A 
          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources"", by Dan A. Davidson, 
          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a 
          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a 
          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer 
          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, 
          which then converts the pump's motor into an ELECTRIC 
          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that 
          of the earth's rotation, via the 'Coriolis effect', LIKE A 
          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] 
          
               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock 
          Air Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between 
          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression 
          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and 
          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running 
          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also 
          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat 
          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large 
          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  
          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the 
          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] 
          
               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown 
          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between 
          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of 
          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a 
          common household smoke detector. 
          
               One other energy source should be mentioned here, 
          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free 
          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph 
          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION 
          reactor which he calls 'Migma', which uses NON-radioactive 
          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities 
          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be 
          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting 
          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power 
          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the 
          ""Tokamaks"" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, 
          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power 
          for every watt put in.  [""New Times"" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, 
          pages 32-40.] 
          
               And then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that 
          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by 
          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin 
          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake 
          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of 
          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the 
          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with 
          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which 
          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough 
          of it to explain the excess heat generated. 
          
               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called ""laws"" 
          of thermodynamics are NOT so ""absolute"".  For example, the 
          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the 'Reciprocal System', (which he describes in detail 
          in several books such as ""Nothing But Motion"" (1979) and ""The 
          Universe of Motion"" (1984)), in which the physical universe 
          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter 
          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing 
          between them, with-OUT the ""heat death"" predicted by 
          thermodynamic ""laws"".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH 
          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena 
          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some 
          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, 
          seemingly converting ""low-quality energy"" into ""high-quality 
          energy"". 
          
               Also, certain religious organizations such as 'Sant Mat' 
          and 'Eckankar' teach their Members that the physical universe 
          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of 
          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV 
          channels, as described in books like ""The Path of the 
          Masters"", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and ""Eckankar: The Key 
          to Secret Worlds"", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, 
          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly 
          called the 'Astral Plane'.  Long-time Members of these groups 
          have learned to 'Soul Travel' into these higher worlds and 
          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy 
          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical 
          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given 
          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is 
          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled 
          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as 
          those described in the book ""Psychic Discoveries Behind the 
          Iron Curtain"". 
          
               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors 
          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop 
          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional 
          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their 
          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If 
          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of 
          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and 
          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and 
          pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'GREENHOUSE 
          EFFECT', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil 
          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue 
          to increase. 
          
               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development 
          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize 
          private production (until the producers can make it on their 
          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of 
          Free Energy Hardware. 
          
               The long-range effects of such government intervention 
          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy 
          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining 
          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, 
          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to 
          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, 
          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for 
          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, 
          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high 
          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR's, 
          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that 
          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, 
          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be 
          able to realize the ""opportunity costs"" of paying electric 
          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would 
          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to 
          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government 
          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be 
          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE 
          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. 
          
               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of 
          business, but society as a whole, and the earth's environment 
          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.  It is the People, 
          that government should serve, rather than the big 
          corporation$ and bank$.

I do not claim to know anything about him, except this listing of his

I think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level.  You assume
that the general public ""can't handle the truth"" and then, based on this 
assumption, go for the fluff arguments.  Then someone, who can understand a
good argument, comes along and asks ""why don't you just develop the spinoffs?""
or ""why can't we just get our spinoffs from some other program, like the
military?""  There are some good arguments for space development without relying
on its side effects.  I'm not ignoring the value of spinoffs.  I simply think
that the general public deserves more credit than you give them.


And if you're going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right.
Teflon has been around since before NASA.  As I understand it, Velcro was 
conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the
trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes.  Certainly velcro was

see some good evidence before I believe that either of these would not be here
today without NASA.

Well, yes.  This is the real mystery of the matter, and why I am rather
dubious of a lot of the source theories.

There are a number of places where the Masoretic Text (MT) of the OT is
obscure and presumably corrupted.  These are reproduced exactly from copy to
copy.  The DSS tend to reflect the same ""errors"".  This would appear to tell
us that, at least from some point, people began to copy the texts very
exactingly and mechanically.  The problem is, we don't know what they did
before that.  But it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the
point at which the texts are perceived as texts.  They may be added to (and
in some situations, such as the end of Mark, material is lost), but for the
most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.

You're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill.  Some people
like to use the game of ""telephone"" as a metaphor for the transmission of
the texts.  This clearly wrong.  The texts are transmitted accurately.",0
"I'm not sure if this will help you, but the (local) interstellar
radiation field has been measured and modeled by various groups.  If I
remember things correctly, the models involved contributions from three
different BB sources, so there's no obvious ""temperature"" of background

"RAPTURE - OCTOBER 28, 1992

		WHAT TO DO IN CASE YOU MISS THE RAPTURE

I. STAY CALM AND DO NOT PANIC

	Your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to
panic.  But to do so is absolutely useless now.  If you had wanted to get right
with God before the rapture, you could have, but you chose to wait.  Now your 
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the 
Tribulation.  ""But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be 
saved."" - Matthew 24:13

II. REALIZE YOU ARE NOW LIVING DURING THE GREAT TRIBULATION

	The Great Tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of
the rapture until Christ's second coming.  Also know as ""the time of Jacob's
(Israel's) trouble"" (Jere 30:7) and ""Daniel's Seventieth Week"" (Dan 9), this 
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.

III. GATHER AS MANY BIBLES AS YOU CAN AND HIDE THEM

	Soon after the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community 
(the revived Roman Empire), Bibles will be confiscated and owning a Bible will
be tantamount to treason.  The Bible, however, will be your most valuable 
possession during the Tribulation.

IV. READ THE BIBLE LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER READ IT BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Since all of your Bibles may be confiscated, even if you are careful, it
is imperative that you read the Word until you memorize whole passages and can
quote them.  It is especially important to read Daniel, Luke 21, Matthew 24, 
Revelation, and Amos, for these books describe the events you can expect to
unfold before you.  

V. PRAY LIKE YOU HAVE NEVER PRAYED BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE

	Pray until the power of God comes strongly upon you - pray and pray 
and pray.  Only by reading the Word and praying will you gain the spiritual 
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the
sake of Christ.  

VI. DO NOT TAKE THE MARK AT ANY COST - EVEN IN FIT MEANS YOU AND YOUR LOVED
ONES DIE AS MARTYRS

	After the Antichrist becomes the leader of the European Community, he
will institute a world economic system, designed so that you cannot buy, sell,
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name.  Money will be
useless.  ""And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and 
slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, and that
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast, 
or the number of his name.  Here is wisdom.  Let him who has understanding
calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number
is 666"" - Revelation 13:16-18.  
	The Antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of 
humanity.  Think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed
in the past, such as the Holocaust.
[or maybe the crusades? -M]
You cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the Antichrist's
rule; it will be much worse than anything in history (Matt 24:21) ""...I saw
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and
for the testimony which they held.  And a white robe was given to each of 
them: and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer, 
until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren, who would be
killed as they were, was completed."" Revelation 6:9, 11.
	His targets will be Jews and Christians who do not worship his image
or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn/ ""...And I saw the souls of 
those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of 
God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark
on their foreheads or on the hands."" - Revelation 20:4.  He will use every
form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce Christ.  Nor
will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you, even your children, 
torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take
the mark.  
	If you take the mark or worship the Antichrist or his image, however,
you will be consigned to the second death, which is the Lake of Fire.
[Sung about so eloquently by Johnny Cash...-M]
You cannot be redeemed.  It is better to endure torture for a short while and
gain eternal life then [sic] to endure eternal torment in the Ring^H^H^H^H Lake
of Fire.  ""...If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives his 
mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink the wine of
the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His 
indignation.  An [sic] he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the 
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb."" -Revelation 
14:9-10 

[and probably in the presence of season-ticket holders; special hats given to
the first 5,000 at the stadium --M] 

VII. SET A PLAN IN MOTION FOR SURVIVAL

	Although you may not be able to hide from the Antichrist's government
until the end of the Tribulation, all of the time you gain in hiding is 
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening, since only those who are
extremely strong in Christ can suffer and die for His sake.
	The first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or
mountainous area, for the Antichrist's control will come last to the least
populated areas.  Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay 
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.
[""As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep
into our area by daybreak.  Expect delays on I-95 outbound, and perhaps school
closings"" --M] 
Store water and food, because you will not be able to purchase anything without
the mark.  Water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.
[Get a good water filter. --M]
Bring different types of clothing for all seasons, as well as flashlights,
batteries, generators, and First Aid supplies.  In short, learn how to 
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.

VIII. TRUST NO ONE
	
	There will be secret agents everywhere, spying for the Antichrist's
government.  Be on the lookout.
[Perot supporters take note --M]

IX. WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST

	It is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel 
11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a
half years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be 
physically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and 
personality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic
expert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which
he will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural 
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will
be deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.
[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]
	The antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who
will make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  
All who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and
a half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.

X. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!

	The seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of
Christ.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you 
will be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  
	Start reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of 
your sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take
the mark or worship the Antichrist.  You still have a chance to be saved or
remain saved, but this time you will have to be ""faithful unto death.""

	May God find you ready in the hour of his glorious return!

If I may offer a constructive criticism, perhaps you should decide if you
love vehicles or the use they are put to. I, myself, think the F-86 is
a beautiful aircraft, but rest assured, I wouldn't even think of flying
it in combat today. Most of us want access to space and judge vehicles
on how they perform.


Not to this degree.


Why?


Your wrong. The DC approach is very tollerent of failure. It also has
the advantage of far greater reliability do to its reusable nature (Shuttle
isn't reusable, it's salvagable).


The flip over happens at a very low speed, not supersonic. If the DC-X
shows the flip over works, it will work unless the laws of physics change.


The final DC-1 will have fully intact abort throughout the entire flight
envelop. Upon re-entry for example, it can loose about 80% of available
thrust and still land safely.


Everything can suffer from catastrophic failure but that's not the same
thing. Shuttle simply isn't a fault tolerent design, SSTO is.


You don't put your patients in conditions where there is no way out. You
wouldn't for example, give a patient a drug and not monitor them for
harmful side effects would you?


You are very much in the minority. If the DC series fails to make orbit, it
will still be a very worthwhile effort. It will show us EXACTLY what we do
need to do to build SSTO.


Again, refering to the DC-1, it will provide fully intact abort theroughout
the flight envelop. Shuttle doesn't. DC is fault tollerent, Shuttle isn't.


Not true. Build a passenger pallet (a fairly easy thing to do) and it will
carry passengers.


I would suggest you talk to the DC-X crew themselves. Their original
schedule had an operational DC-1 flying in 96.


Your ignoring the dammage it does. Mannes space has a reputation for being
unreliable and hugely expensive. Shuttle supporters only make it easy for
opponents of manned space to kill it.


The only way to prove those things is to build it.

Please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
actively religious (e.g. actual prayer, ""Amen"" after a moment of
silence, mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have
possible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of
silence, having the Bible on the shelves during reading period) is not
a way to prevent a state religion.

  ""There's nothing wrong if Microsoft setting the standards for the computer

  Where has the hacker ethic gone?  Not the ""cracker"" ethic, which is something
entirely different and bad, but the hacker ethic, which tells us to value the
free distribution of information and yield to the hands-on imperative?  Why is
it that people and corporations like Bill Gates, IBM, and Intel are able to
have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry?  Why is it that, if a person
like myself posts messages to Usenet on how to get into the little nooks,
crannies, and idiosyncrasies of a computer system, they are not given any
useful information by those who know, just a badmouthing? (or are completely
ignored)  Why is it that people like Steve Jobs have to abandon their efforts to
make truly innovative products?  I ask those of you who call yourselves
hackers, why is this?  And further, how can you let it go on?  It is a fact
that the computer industry has changed the world, and shall continue to do so
for a long time to come.  It has allowed the propagation of information in a
volume unheard of even twenty years ago, and has made this world even smaller
than it was before.  I shudder to think what that world will be like if the
corporations are allowed to have their way, perpetuating more drivel like the
286, Windows, and the IBM product line on the computer-using public.  

  That is not to say I am against business per se; people who profit off of
innovative, intelligent, creative designs do not bother me.  In fact, I applaud
it; that is the American way.  But those who manage to sell kludgy, uncreative
systems to the public, and profit off of them, are the ones who are the
problem.  And, unfortunately, because they have enough money to make up for
blunt stupidity, they can keep doing it for a very long time.

  I put it to you thus:  Where HAS the hacker ethic gone?  If it still exists,
where?  And, if it DOES exist, why are those who call themselves ""hackers""
allowing this to perpetuate itself?  Why are they not creating new, innovative,
interesting ideas to stop the SOS from maintaining its choke hold on the

That's fine idea, but it only works if the lighting/power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures.  For instance, a power company in Virginia 
recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various
type.  Yet, all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell
were bad designs - one that wasted the light.  Thus, you couldn't even buy
a good light from them.  In most places, to get a good light, you have to
either order it special at high cost or call a store in Arizona.  At some
point, society starts to make rules.  Cars have to pass safety tests.  
Companies have to meet pollution standards, etc..  There are two ways to achieve this:  educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code
down the lighting companies backs.  History seems to suggest that the latter
is more likely to work.

This is actually more like the stuff from Phase A and MOL....Phase B ended

"Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating
that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must
discount every other book of antiquity:


Mr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything
written in every ""historical"" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself
that.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical
document, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith
in the words of the books attributed to Peter. 

I shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you
reject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by
Matthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were
carved with the Pharoah's specific approval so we have true originals, rather
than mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285
BC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). 
The Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory
inscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in
near perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much
single-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. 

Note that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. 
The following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume
II.

	My majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall
	on their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into
	the water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;
	I attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and
	my chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking
	back.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors
	me, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,
	in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.

(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses ""divine word,"" but also that
there were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of 
battle.)

	Then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces
	of the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other
	with him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and
	found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...

	No officer was with me, no charioteer,
	No soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;
	My infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,
	Not one of them stood firm to fight with them.
	His majesty spoke: ""What is this, father Amun?
	Is it right for a father to ignore his son?
	Are my deeds a matter for you to ignore?
	Do I not walk and stand at your word?
	I have not neglected an order you gave.
	Too great is he, the great lord of Egypt,
	To allow aliens to step on his path!
	What are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,
	The wretches ignorant of god?
	Have I not made for you many great monuments,
	...
	I call to you, my father Amun,
	I am among a host of strangers;
	All countries are arrayed against me,
	I am alone, there's none with me!
	...
	The labors of many people are nothing,
	Amun is more helpful than they;
	I came here by the command of your mouth,
	O Amun, I have not transgressed your command!""

	Now though I prayed in a distant land,
	My voice resounded in Southern Thebes.
	I found Amun came when I called to him,
	He gave me his hand and I rejoiced.
	He called from behind as if near by:
	""Forward, I am with you,
	I your father, my hand is with you,
	I prevail over a hundred thousand men,
	I am lord of victory, lover of valor!""
	I found my heart stout, my breast in joy,
	All I did succeeded, I was like Mont.
	...
	I slaughtered among them at my will,
	Not one looked behind him,
	Not one turned around,
	Whoever fell down did not rise.
	...
	One called out to the other saying:
	""No man is he who is among us,
	It is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;
	Not deeds of man are these his doings,
	They are of one who is unique,
	Who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,
	Come quick, flee before him,
	To seek life and breathe air;
	For he who attempts to get close to him,
	His hands, all his limbs grow limp.
	One cannot hold either bow or spears,
	When one sees him come racing along!""
	My majesty hunted them like a griffin,
	I slaughtered among them unceasingly.

So you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous 
battle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being
*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own
words: 

    ""question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,
     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?""

Do you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your
""all or nothing"" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy
with their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter
(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,
forces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find
completely credible. 

As to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he
must be true:

 
I have three points.  

First, this is ""argumentum ad populum"" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you
cannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu's past and
present who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for
the existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to
the testimony of Hindus:

	""With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of 
	 the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete 
	 hooey?""

If you do so ""scoff,"" then how do you objectively justify your own special
pleading?

Second, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to
Jesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. 

Third, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that
he had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was
much discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a
deist.  Oh my).  I am presently collecting a FAQ for Lincoln as I've
previously done for Tyre, Jefferson and etc.

This definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into
the support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There
was little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of
state universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.
The US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was
mainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that
many research universities, but they all provided their researchers with
low teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for
travel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a
university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well
as salary.

During WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure
scientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they 
were not exactly in the areas of the scientists' expertise.  This is
probably because of the ""research mind"" approach, which is not to try
to find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution
emerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to
discussion about their problems, the job got done.

The military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the
future, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was
unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the
future supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as 
NSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly
keep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,
making it more difficult for them to act to support research.

The worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which
the government supports research the university will not provide funding,
and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,
as has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of
a graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask
for one?  The answer I will get is, ""Get the money from NSF.""  Now the
money at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it
comes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from
getting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects
get supported, and how much.  

Also, the government decided that the ""wealth"" should be spread.  So instead
of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research
institutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into
being.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating
reseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal
has to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals
already done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am
proposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find 
impossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.  In addition, tomorrow
I may get unexpected research results.  Possibly I may bet a bright idea
which solves yesterday's too difficult problem, or a whole new approach to
something I had not considered can develop.  This is the nature of the beast, 
and except for really vague statements, if something can be predicted, it
is not major research, but development or routine activity not requiring 
more than minimal attention of a good researcher.  

I believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would
have happened if the government had never gotten into it, and the government
is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders.",2

No, this is far from clear.  We only have the word of the FBI spokepeople that
a survivor made this claim.  We have the contradictory word of the lawyers who
spoke with the survivors individually that ALL of them agreed that they did
NOT have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire.  In the absense
of any more evidence, I don't see how we can decide who to believe.
Furthermore, its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that
some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else.
With the state of the area now, we may never know what happened.


Again, we have only the word of the FBI on this claim.  The lawyers who
have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim.


I will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities.  Its more likely
that the BD's started the fire than did the FBI.  But there is currently NO
way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence
(which is nearly none).


   D.   The fire was an started accidentally by the BDs.  I am truely amazed that
        I have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.
        With all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and
        the adults wearing gas masks, it had to have been chaotic inside.
        I can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or
        accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over.  With the winds, it
        would have quickly gotten out of control.


   No, I think that D is also quite reasonable.  I personally can't really
asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if
forced to bet on the issue, I would probably take an accident (either FBI or
BD) over intential setting of the fire).

   I would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered
had gunshot wounds.  The coroner was on the Today Show this morning and categorically
denied that they've reach any such conclusions.  He pointed out that under intense
heat, sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and
that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is
quite consisted with te reports I've read and heard.

   In short, there's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many
scenarios as to what happened on Monday.  We should remain skeptical until
more information is available.

"

Well, there are several bursts in species diversity I can think of.
The Cambrian and Ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase
in animal diversity. Likewise, after the one-two punch of the
Permian and Triassic extinctions, the number of marine animals
rose steadily (**) to an all-time high (*) just prior to the spread 
of humans.

(**) biggest exception being the K/T (bye bye dinos) extinction

(*) about 800 families

Also, plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in
succesive sweeps. Mosses colonized very wet environments first,
ferns (who had evolved vascular tissues) took over more territory
when they evolved (1). These were eventually (mostly) replaced by gymnosperms
(pines and the like) (2) and then (mostly) displaced by angiosperms (flowering
plants -- now the dominant plant group on the planet(3). Fungi
also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land. 

(1) around the carboniferous (up to about 200 families)
(2) around the triassic (up to maybe 250 families)
(3) starting in the cretaceous (rising to about 600 families currently)

It's unclear (to me at least) what the max equilibrium number
of species the earth can hold (***) and if it has ever hit this
in the past. It could be (warning: speculation alert) that
diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions
happen often enough to keep the total number down.

(***) This would depend a great deal on how fragmented
specific ecosystems were. 

See Cowen's book ""History of Life"" for a not-too-technical
run-down on, well, like the title sez, the history of life.
Or see, Wilson's ""Diversity of Life"" for a view centered more
on current ecology -- this is (IMHO) the best popular biology
book of (what the hell, I'll say it) all time.

                         The Dream Machines:
An Illustrated History of the Spaceship in Art, Science, and Literature

                            By Ron Miller
                  with Foreword by Arthur C. Clarke

Krieger Publishing Company
Melbourne, Florida, USA
Orig. Ed. 1993
Pre-publication $84.50
ISBN 0-89464-039-9


This text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a
technological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the
space betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the
tlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make
such a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized
that there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to
reach them.   

Tracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,
attempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of
technology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel
became feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed
than ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that
matter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason
as the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate
reflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and
knowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as
well as selected events important in developing the idea of
extraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological
entries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and
speculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between
simultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal
connections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every
entry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every
spacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This
allows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize
differences, similarities, and influences.

This text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,
and also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic
diagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and
historians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The
unique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and
very interesting history of the spaceship.

SPECIAL FEATURES

Includes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and
fictional

Contains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos
contemporary with the subject.  This includes extremely rare
illustrations from scarce books and novels, exclusive photos and
drawings fromSoviet spacecraft; rare stills from both famous and
obscure science fiction films, and unpublished photographs from NASA
archives

An index, bibliography, and appendices are included.

"Wm Hathaway comments;



I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to
somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded
by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be
sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,
our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts
that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,
not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all
of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally
unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,
just because it has changed the way we strive.

BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make
it better.

The reference to it's not yet being ethics is dubious. You have used the terms
absolute, objective and others interchangeably. Same with moral values, values,
at all, worth, measuers, and usefulness. You infer from them as if they were
the same.
 
To the IF. When the If is not fulfilled, your intermission is a waste of time.
Assuming that you don't intend this, it is reasonable to conclude that you
want to argue a point.
 
You have made a interesting statement here, namely that of the disinterested
observer. There is no such thing in morals. Probably the shortest proof for
objective and morality being a contradiction.
 
 
 
Fine. And that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. I could
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (Not that that wasn't
mentioned before). In other words, you have nothing to fulfill your strong
claims with.
 
 
 
Clutching a straw. I don't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were
loaded terms are fixpoints. Those who deny the morality of freedom make quite
clear what they say, their practice is telling. Yes, there are even those who
are willingly unfree. It is quite common in religions, by the way. For one,
there is a religion which is named Submission.
 
Don't even try to argue that submission is freedom.
 
 
 
If it were so, it would argue my case. But I am afraid that that is considered
proof.

An ""Islamic Bank"" is something which operates in a different fashion to
your modern bank, as I have explained here (on another thread) before.
For example, Islamic banks don't pay fixed interests on deposits, but a
return on investments (which varies according to the market, and is not
fixed like interest is).

Islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the Islamic world.
There are no Islamic banks in ""the West"", including the USA, to my
knowledge.  I doubt if the market for them exists there -- at least not
while ""Islamic banks"" are at a relatively early stage of their
development as is the case now.  BCCI is most certainly not an ""Islamic
bank"" -- did BCCI ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits?  If the
answer to this question is ""yes"", then BCCI was not an Islamic bank, as
Islamic banks are specifically set up to _not_ pay or charge interest.

Whether some Muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely
irrelevant.  ",0

First and foremost, I honestly do not believe that Jesus was anything
more than a man who lived and died two thousand years ago.  I know
your Bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did,
but I simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has
any bearing on this universe or the lives in it, and I similarly do
not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.

Period.

I view religion in general and Christianity in specific as a 'cultural
virus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because
people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim
responsibility for their own fate, so they brainwash themselves and
their children into believing the popular myths, and it goes on from
there.  And eventually Christianity becomes a given -- if so many
other people believe in it, it must be right, no?

I don't believe in any ""life after death"".  I believe that when I die,
I die, so therefore it's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose
to my life in the meantime.  I don't believe that it's a good thing to
humble myself and view pride as a sin -- pride, in moderation, is a
constructive thing.  I see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and
nothing inferior about women, and my priests lost a lot of my trust
when they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these
opinions to me.  I don't believe in 'loving everyone', especially
people I've never met; while I try to show respect to everyone, my
love and admiration is something not easily earned, and I do not feel
guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has
abused it.

If you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously, stop
trying to show me how the Bible ""makes sense"".  Start trying to show
me that this Jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone's life
here on Earth.

When Robert refers to the ""orthodox"", he is talking about the Historical
position of the Christian Faith. Such things are derived from Biblcal
texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.

You are right that people read things differently in the Bible, and this
is alright in parts like parables and such forth. However, when it comes
to the essential doctrines of the Historical Orthodox Christan Beliefs,
there is only one correct way to read it. For example, either the
doctrine of the Trinity is true, or it is false. Yes, people read the
texts differently, but only one position is true. They both cannot be.
According to the text, the doctrine is true and has always existed.",3

"I'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3D key frame
positions (x,y,z) to control an imaginary camera movement.  I'm
using Kochanek-Bartels splines (as described in the SIGGRAPH '84
proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames.  I want the inbetweens to be given in the form
(x,y,z,dx,dy,dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x, y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at (x,y,z).

The method presented by Kochanek and Bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated.  I've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
not key frames), but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
the spatial movement seems to work fine; and I'm quite certain
- I think :) - that I've not simply made an implementation
error...)

Now I wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.

Yes, as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless.  This is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy Christians' disbelief in
Zeus is worthless.  Atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources, building non-god-based ideas in the same
way as Christians build non-Zeus-based ideas of thunderbolts.
Atheists no more *base* their philosophy on atheism than Christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of Zeus.

The ""weak atheist"" position is logically extremely assailable -- any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist.  Atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration, and they all fail
miserably.  In fact, most of the people around here who claim the
""strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist"" position do so on this
basis: not only do we not believe in a god, but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound;
therefore, one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist.  This doesn't apply to such philosophers' gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable, but these are not the gods of
popular religion, and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable. ",3

   Kaliningrad is easily reachable by auto from Moscow, and tours

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:



In other words, to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
Tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

As to the other bits - you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in XV. If
that was not what you meant, then:


Yes, I probably did. I found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. Sorry
if I misunderstood.


Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

Actually, I find the stuff about JC being a carpenter more
interesting.  Is there an independent source for this assertion,
or is it all from the Christian Bible?  Is there any record at
all of anything he built?  A table, a house, some stairs (Norm
Abrams says the real test of a carpenter's skill is building
stairs with hand tools).  Did he leave any plans behind for, say
kitchen counters and cabinets?  Did he build his own cross?
If so, did he use pressure-treated lumber?  Gotta use that
pressure-treated anywhere that wood meets concrete, but it
holds up better anyway for mose outdoor applications.  I keep
seeing these bumper-stickers that say ""My boss is a Jewish
Carpenter,"" but they're always on the back of Ford Escorts,
and a real carpenter's apprentice would probably drive a
pickup, so I'm out for verification that he really was a
carpenter.

Yup.

Most JPEG viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards. Some have the standard IBM BIOS video support for
the VGA 320x200 256 colour mode, but they leave out the other cards such as
the Hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right).

I can't remember the name of a JPEG viewer since I usually convert JPEG's to
GIF's before viewing them. But some require VESA driver for the video cards.
You don't need any special hardware to view JPEG's except perhaps for a VGA
card and maybe a 286+ processor. Most people these days program for 286+
computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086, 8088). I have a
8088 clone (a NEC V20 processor) and a Hercules card, I have had to write
some programs so that they will view GIF's and animations for the VGA and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome Hercules card. I use Floyd-Steinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems. CompuShow 8.50 has FS dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering, my way
gives a brighter more detailed image.

Anyway, enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. The final point is, as
far as I know, you don't need extra hardware to view JPEG's other than the
VGA (and perhaps a 286 or better)

Oh no, not again.

There is a difference between believing that God exists, and loving him.
(For instance, Satan certainly believes God exists, but does not love him.)
What unbelievers request in situations like this is that God provide evidence
compelling enough to believe he exists, not to compel them to love him.

too say ""religion did this"".  I'm saying that the causes are far more

prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street
corners for people to see them.  I tell you solemnly, they

You should have heard Prof. McNally , from my days as an astronomy
undergraduate, denouncing photon pollution. It was easy to imagine him
taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street
outside Mill Hill observatory with a 12-gauge shotgun :-)

However, seriously, it is possible to limit the effects of
streetlights, by adding a reflector, so that the light only
illuminates the ground, which is after all where you need it. As a
bonus, the power consumption required for a given illumination level
is reduced. Strangely enough, astronomers often seek to lobby elected
local authorities to use such lighting systems, with considerable
success in the desert areas around the major US observatories. At
least, thats what McNally told us, all those years ago.
( British local authorities couldn`t care less, as far as I can see )

I suppose that the ""right"" to dark skies is no more than an aspiration,
but it is a worthwhile one. Illuminated orbital billboards seem especially
yukky, and are presumably in the area of international law, if any, although

Let's start with the name ""Rosicrucian"". I took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a
""rosicrucian"" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met
some 'rosicrucians' you mean ""members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian"". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)


Response:

This makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.
There is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people
who call themselves 'Hindus' or 'Christians' or 'Pagans' and actually
*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important
requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'.  I find that
the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be
interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that
'mysticism' is the core of every religion and Huxley's 'Perennial
Philosophy' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>


Tony:

I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium
Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this
newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in
San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I
looked). Of course, ""most members"" does not *necessarily* mean ""best"".


Response:

Certainly true.  I didn't know there WERE any groups which called themselves
'Rosicrucians' that didn't associate with AMORC.  Sure, I've heard all the
hubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these
Western esoteric groups, but hadn't heard about other 'Rosicrucians'.
I'll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>


Tony:

""You'll have to trust me"" when I tell you that if that
lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. 


Response:

This may be slightly off.  I've met some of these Rosicrucians and have
a couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I've heard and the slight contact
I've had with them does not give me the hope that I'd be received with
any kind of warm welcome.  I still like to think that most people who
are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy, religion, etc.)
are in DEEP pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.


Tony:

     
It is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-
sectarian*.


Response:

I'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call 
themselves 'Rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'.
Is this 'nonsectarian' like the Masons, who require that a member 'believe
in God by his/her definition'?

     
     
Tony:

I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with ""us containing
something divine""... And yes I don't like phrases like ""eternal bliss""
either! :-)


Response:

Let alone us *BEING* something divine. ;>


Tony:

BTW, I have read the intro letters of the LRC which they will mail you free
of charge.

Ok, so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy
computer algorythims, but have you looked ad the Hubble results, the
defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software (see
those jupiter pictures for results), but is the effects are completely
reversable, why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it?

The way I see it (and please, astromomers give me a swift net-kick in
the butt if i'm out of the ball park), the astromers are making the
best of limited possiblities, there's only one hubble, and the shuttle
makes another in the near future a non-thought.  Perhaps those self
same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind
mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror's (if that is what is used)
and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope...

"It is interesting to note in the past few days' correspondance that some
believe that poor old New Mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial
space launch business.  For many reasons, it can, and we here on the front
lines see no reason why it should not.  The 'spaceport political publicity'
referred to the other day had its intended effect - the state of New Mexico
did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a
commercial space port.  The commanding general at WSMR is in full support of
dual-use for the facilities.  The WSMR location also has some strategic
advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space
to support the project.  Just because the folks involved have not done the
traditional aerospace-equivalent of vapor-ware by inviting folks out to kick
non-existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for
launch, don't think that nothing has happened.  From my interactions with
the MACDAC folks, I get the impression that they want to set a firm,
believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction
to plug a space on a calendar.  I believe that all will happen this summer
and don't worry, the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it
does occur.

According to this reasoning there are no rights, at least none that I can think 
of....

Let's see.  Do I have a right to unpolluted air?  No, because the majority
drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process.

Do I have the right to clean water?  I guess not, by the same reasoning.
I could go on with these examples for a long time....

Look at Nazi Germany.  Because of the majority, Jews, homosexuals, blacks,
and others that were different had no rights.  In fact they were terrorized, 
imprisoned, and slaughtered.  In this country did blacks have the right to be
free from slavery?  I guess not, because the majority said that slavery was 
good for them.

I think that a right has a moral imperative.  If a law, imposed by the majority,
is immoral, one should not follow it.  In fact, one should do everything in
his/her power to stop it. Of course, that doesn't mean that I would lose all
common sense to break the law, just because I thought it was immoral.  I pay
my Federal Income Tax even though I am morally opposed to the U.S. Government
taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism.
This is precisely the point I am trying to make.  We should _persude_ people 
by logic, pointing out that it is in their self-interest to let all have
equal rights in all aspects of life, including adequate housing, food, and
medical care.  I just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of
beauty and joy is also necessary.  That is why I consider an uncluttered
night sky a right.

Have you ever been out in the desert, away from local lights, and most people?
The sky is dark and transparent.  The Milky Way is ablaze with more detail
than you thought possible.  The beauty and wonder takes your breath away.

Now imagine you live in the worst ghetto, say in L.A. Due to light pollution
you have never seen a dark sky.  You might in fact never, not in your whole
life, ever see the majesty of the night sky.  Every where around you, you see
squalor, and through your life runs a thread of dispair. What is there to live
for?  

I admit these two scenarios are extreme examples, but I have seen both.
I, for one, need dreams and hopes, and yes, beauty, as a reason for living.

of her philosophy reflects not only a European education but a

I've heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy
between the ""Continental"" and British/American schools, Rand belongs in
the former in terms of methodology et al, even though she was trying to
say things that would belong in the latter school.

I suppose you don't know what about we have discussed.
We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

So far I have seen a colormap editing window in XV -- that is, there
must be a colormap anyway. The problems you present are exist anyway,
and I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

Gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image
back to 24 bit image.



Ok, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

My solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit
image -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.


About changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
XV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

Moreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global
changes. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
If person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit
image, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --
selecting individual color is possible from that.

Ok, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...



It saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not
designed for that.
Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
expected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work -- design error.

I have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Before anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,
even the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.
(Americans: the lift is just an example :)

Supernovae put out 10^53 or 10^54 (i forget which, but it's only an
order of magnitude...).  Not in gamma rays, though.  You'd hafta get
all of that into gammas if they were at 9 Mpc, but if a decent fraction
of the SN output was in gammas it could reasonably be extragalactic 
(but closer than 9 Mpc).  I dunno SN theory so well, but I can't think
of how to get many gammas out.  Maybe I should look it up.

Big radio galaxies can put out 10^46 erg/s *continually*.  That's just
in the radio... there are a lot of gammas around them, too, but ""bursts""?
Nah.

Neither of these should be taken as explanations... just trying to show

Dear Prospective Employer:

I am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
design and development, in which I can utilize my experience in hardware, 
C & C++ programming, graphical user interface (GUI), operating systems and
computer networking.

I received my Bachelors of Engineering (BE) degree in Electronics
Engineering in 1990 and a M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering in Dec 1992 
from Iowa State University. Currently I am enrolled in a M.S. in Computer
Engineering at Iowa State University.

During my Masters program, as a research assistant since Jan 1991, I have
published three papers including one in the IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.
These papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
to learn new concepts quickly.

I have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
have extensive experience programming in C, C++, Fortran and Assembly Level. 
I am also familiar with operating systems like Unix, Ultrix and MS-DOS.
I am familiar with Motif/X programming and currently, as a research assistant,
am involved in graphical user interface (GUI) design using the multiplatform 
GUI toolkit XVT++. My experiences also include areas such as operating systems
and computer networks, through course work and projects. I was involved in the
study of the design and development of the internals of the XINU operating
system. I have also been involved in many TCP/IP programming projects in
computer networking.

While in college I learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.
I have also learned a lot about time management. In my M.S. program I
have maintained a 3.70 grade average, worked 20 hours per week and
have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.

My software experiences along with my hardware background (Electronics
Engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.
I request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. I would like to
have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals. 
I am eager to hear from you soon.


Sincerely

Or perhaps you write a freely available, GPLed unix for commonly

you found a Legue for Programming Freedom to fight restrictive litigation

So nothing.  It may work for some, but not for others: it doesn't give any
insight into an overall God or overall truth of a religion- it would seem to be
dependent solely on the individual, as well as individually-created.  And since
Christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better
than ours, I do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary, or even
particularly attractive.


Well, we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not, but at the
very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that, say, there
was a military conflict in Vietnam 25 years ago, then there is a supernatural
diety who wants us to live a certain way.  The fact that Jesus warned against
it means nothing.  *I* warn against it too.  Big deal.


This is not true.  The first two choices here (life and death) are scantily
documented, and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the Bible, and
that is totally circular.  Perhaps it be better to use the imagination, or
one's ignorance.  Someone else will address this I'm sure, and refer you to
plenty of documentation...


How is this?  There is nothing more disgusting than Christian attempts to
manipulate/interpret the Old Testament as being filled with signs for the
coming of Christ.  Every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is
autmoatically interpreted as the Cross.  What a miscarriage of philology.


Well, since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness,) there is no way to get
into us.  Here we have the irreconcilable difference: Christians glorify
exactly what we tend to despise or snub: trust/belief/faith without knowledge. 
If I am lucky one day and I happen to be thinking of God at the same time my
enkephalins go up, then I may associate this as a sign of God (it will ""feel""
right, and I will trust without knowing).  Maybe.  Religosity does not seem to
be anything that is conclusively arrived at, but rather it seems to be more of
a sudden affliction...
I believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed, many of us were
not.  The question is, is suchg an attitude reflective of a _correct_ or
healthy morality.  IT would seem not to be.  The same thing could reflect
fanaticism, for example, and is any case an expression of simple selfishness.

I think C.S. Lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the
world is flat.

However, this argument goes both ways. Pretend someone telling Plato that
it is highly probable that people do not really have souls; their minds
and their consciousness are just something their brains make up, and
their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in 
voluntarly actions. I don't think Plato would have been happy with this,
and neither would Paul, although Paul's ideas were quite different.
However, if you would _read_ what we discuss in this group, and not
just preach, you would see that there currently is much evidence in
favour of these statements.

The same applies to the theory of natural selection, or other sacred
cows of Christianity on our origins and human nature. I don't believe
in spirits, devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.


Ah, you said it. You believe what you want to. This is what I had assumed
all along. 


You might be as well planting Satan's seeds, ever thought of this?
Besides, you haven't yet explained why we must believe so blindly,
without any guiding light at all (at least I haven't noticed it).
I don't think this is at all fair play on god's part. 

Your argument sounds like a version of Pascal's Wager. Please read the
FAQ, this fallacy is discussed there.

relevence, it's what I think of as human nature. I'm not sure it
undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special
knowledge about the Truth and since such claims are always suspect,
all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species.
My point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human
claims. The trick here then, is to find some way to abstract our
infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we
can see what there is to see. I can think of no way this can be done.",0

"Here is someones ""biblical"" claim for the characteristics of Satan:


And separately:


We have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil's
decision making, a specific desire, and a physical description.  Now, in
support (aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased
account of the opposition) we see:


ISA 14:12  How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
morning!  how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst weaken
the nations!

ISA 14:13  For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend  into
                                              --------------------
heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit
-----------------------------------------------------
also upon the mount of the congregation,  in  the  sides  of the north:

ISA 14:14  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I  will
be like the most High.

ISA 14:15  Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to  the  sides
of the pit.


Doesn't say sits on God's throne.  Says will exhault throne above the stars.


DAN 10:12  Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for  from the
first  day  that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to
chasten thyself before thy God, thy words were heard,  and  I am
come for thy words.

DAN 10:13  But the prince of the kingdom of Persia  withstood me
                    ------------------------------
one  and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes,
                                        ------------------------
came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

DAN 10:14  Now I am come to make thee understand what  shall be-
fall  thy  people  in  the latter days: for yet the vision is for
many days.


See who is being discussed?



EZE 28:12  Son of man, take up a lamentation  upon  the  king of
                                                     -----------
Tyrus, and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Thou sealest up
-----
the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.

EZE 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God;  every  pre-
cious  stone  was  thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the dia-
mond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the em-
erald,  and  the  carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy ta-
brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that  thou
wast created.

EZE 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have
set  thee  so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast
walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

EZE 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day  that  thou
wast created, till iniquity was found in thee.

EZE 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they  have  filled
the  midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore
I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain  of  God:  and  I
will  destroy  thee,  O  covering  cherub,  from the midst of the
stones of fire.

EZE 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty,  thou
hast  corrupted  thy  wisdom  by reason of thy brightness: I will
cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that  they
may behold thee.

EZE 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of
thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will
I bring forth a fire from the midst  of  thee,  it  shall  devour
thee,  and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight
of all them that behold thee.

EZE 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be as-
tonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be
any more.

"Dear Netters:


I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a

concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. ""Ray-casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index"". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. It says ""if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra..."". Again how to make
sure ?


   Any pointers are welcome ?

I would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue.
Even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination,
grasp at straws, or do other strange things when faced with extreme
suffering, not to mention physiological problems which may lead to
diminished mental capacity.

At the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to
authority I remind readers of what I posted a while back as a kind of
obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview
rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time
a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.
He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a
respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.
After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say
it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if
you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this.
People are different. I admire Dr. Sabin for admitting his human weakness
in that instance. I would not think less of Asimov for similar weakness.

Nevertheless I agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may
well be untrue. In any case they are not evidence for anything besides
the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.",0

Wow! You got me thinking now!

This is an interesting question in that recently there has been a 
move in society to classify previously ""socially unacceptable"" yet legal 
activities as OK.  In the past it seems to me there were always two 
coexisting methods of social control.

First (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of 
actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set 
of punishments.

Secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are 
the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered 
by legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if 
socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed 
since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of 
social censure.

The control manifests itself in day-to-day life as ""guilt"" and 
""morality"".  I've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren't for 
the VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be 
absolutely impossible.

Lately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to 
attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain't 
illegal, then don't pick on me).  I'm not saying this is wrong, merely 
that it is a byproduct of a society which has:

	1) A high education level,
	2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,
	3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and
	4) A ""me"" oriented culture.

I guess what I'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, 
here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\
can't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we 
are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as 
those freedoms don't impinge on another's.

IMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we 
appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old 
territoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, 
inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the 
continued destabilization of society.  

I got no quick fix.  I have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this 
mess.  I know I would never consent to the roll-back of personal freedoms 
in order to ""stabilize"" society.  Yet I believe development of societies 
follow a Darwinian process which selects for stability.  Can we find a 
social model which maximizes indiv. freed.'s yet is stable?  Perhaps it is 
possible to live with a ""non-stable"" society?

Anybody see a way out?  Comments?

PS.  Therefore answer to question #3:  We don't.  Do we want to?

Yes.  Here's what you should do.

Keep the vertices in an array, and have the polygons (triangles are okay,
but n-sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into
the array of the vertices that comprise them.  You set a flag for each
vertex when you transform it, so you don't have to transform any vertex
more than once; you also do backface elimination before processing the
polygon, so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys don't have
to be transformed at all.

Whenever you transform a vertex, check if it's on the far side of the hither
plane; if it is, you can project it right away and store the result.

Then do your Z clip; any vertices that get produced will have to have their
projection done at that stage.

I too am a Jules Verne collector, and can tell you that though tough 
to find, it *is* out there.  I keep my eyes open all the time for his
books at various Bay Area used book stores, and every once in a while
get *very* lucky.  You just need diligence.  I don't know if the book
store situation near JSC is as good as the Bay Area, but good luck.
I have also had excellent luck at the Antiquarian Book Fair which comes
to SF every other year, though the prices are more in the $100-$200 range
than the $50 you want to spend.  My guess is that *if* you find it,
you won't need to spend even that much, since most people don't care 
about it.  I think I paid about $15 for my dust-jacket-less but otherwise
good condition copy, which I found one day at a small bookshop that happened
to have just bought a lot of random books at an estate sale.  

Of course, if you re willing to buy blind, you can put a $2 advertisement
in the Antiquarian Bookseller's newsletter (the exact title of which escapes
me at the moment.)  _Five Weeks in a Balloon_ is not the rarest of Jules
Verne books.  Someone has it for sale somewhere, and the AB is the way to 
find it.  In fact, I would be surprised if you didn't get multiple offers
of sale.  Of course, that takes the fun out of hunting for it yourself...

Good luck.",2

Society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self-defined
rules.  In terms of UN decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented
at the UN are considered part of that society. If we then look at US federal
laws provided by representatives of purely US citizens then the society for
that case would be the citizens of the US and so on.


""Acceptable"" are those behaviours which are either legislated for the
society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are
non-verbally and, in effect, non-consciously, such as picking your nose on
the Oprah Winfrey show, no-one does it, but there is no explicit law against
doing it. In many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a
behaviour is ""acceptable"", but one can deduce these behaviours by
observation.



In an increasingly litigation mad society, this trap is becoming exceedingly
difficult to avoid. With the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures
in American (and Australian, to bring in my local perspective) culture the
boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may
eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. For instance, some
cultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals.
Most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. However, is
it moral, according to the multicultural american society? This kind of
problem may only be definable by legislation. 

Obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is
acceptable behaviour or not, and much of this will be due to different
environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.  

One thing is for sure, there is no universal moral code which will suit all
cultures in all situations.  There may, however, be some globally accepted
mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable
concept. The majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon
this earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).",0
"Brian Ceccarelli wrote (that's me):


Kent Sandvik responds:


I think I see where you are coming from Kent.  Jesus doesn't view
guilt like our modern venacular colors it.   

""Feelings"" have nothing to do with guilt.  Feelings arise from the state of 
being guilty.  Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a 
reaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the 
reaction.   Let me give you an example:

Have you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a
little white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really 
didn't know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?
Are you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You
are guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  
Feelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus's use of the word
""guilt"" as how a court uses it.

Jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being
imperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do
bad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our 
guilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. 
We are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is
not a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us
sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a
human being.  Guilty as charged.


You can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you
made a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in
the meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the
way Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.

Or two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself
and feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to
say a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way 
Jesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this 
category to some extent in their lives.

Jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt
feeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he
loves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That
isn't new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize 
that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.
That is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to 
have your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.
Jesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present
sinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  

God is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into
a round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to
change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.
God has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in
Jesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will
move it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very
being--and us and God communicate with each through his
unifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For
with the divine nature living within us, we can now see
our imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With
the power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power
to help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives 
within us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before
we could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now 
have authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine 
nature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit
is eternal.

The relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because
it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to
heavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.
Remember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he
separated the ""goats from the sheep"".   Many people in the
last day will ask him, ""Didn't I prophesy in your name and do
miracles, and do good things in your name?""   And what did Jesus say?
""Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.""  That is the cornerstone of 
Christianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your 
relationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will
be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  


Good.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you
love yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus
taught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, 
in the common english venacular, ""feeling guilty"" has a
different meaning than the state of guilt.


I believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,
a lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.

Now where did I put my little red book?  Or was that green?

Rick, I think we can safely say, 1) Robert is not the only person
who understands the Bible, and 2), the leadership of the LDS church
historicly never has.  Let's consider some ""personal interpretations""
and see how much trust we should put in ""Orthodox Mormonism"", which
could never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.

        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.
McConkie said they ""thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify
Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised
Messiah."" He also said Christians are wrong to believe ""that Jehovah is
the Supreme Deity [God the Father],"" and that Christ ""came into
mortality"" as His ""Only Begotten"" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons
believe today to be the truth about the matter. He said that ""Elohim is
the Father"" and ""Jehovah is the Son.""

  ""Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists
  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise
  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to
  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the
  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the
  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As
  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the
  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy
  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was
  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.
  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)

        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about
their ""three-in-one God"" and their belief that ""God is a Spirit"" as they
are in their understanding of who ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" are. Before
examining McConkie's attack and its validity, we shall read a few more
statements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words
""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah."" McConkie stated:

  ""...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in
  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the
  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)

  ""_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted
  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his
  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon
  Doctrine, p. 224)

        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who ""Elohim"" and
""Jehovah"" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:

  ""_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus
  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn
  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,
  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)

        ""A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve""
apostles of the Mormon Church states that ""God the Eternal Father...[is]
designate[d] by the exalted name-title 'Elohim'..."" (Articles of Faith,
p. 466) ""...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied
state...was known as Jehovah..."" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)

        Today Mormon leaders teach that ""Elohim"" in the OT refers to God
the Father and ""Jehovah"" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians
for saying ""Jehovah"" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two
""name-titles"" should not be changed around so that Christ is called
""Elohim"" and the Father is called ""Jehovah."" ""...the Father...is Elohim,
not Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one
and the same person."" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)

        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word ""Elohim"" is
used to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges
of Israel. When referring to the true God, ""Elohim"" is translated with a
capital ""G."" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges
of Israel, it is translated with a small ""g."" It is translated four
times as ""judges"" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as ""judge"" (1 Sam. 2:25),
twice as ""mighty"" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as ""angels"" (Ps. 8:5),
once as ""godly"" (Mal. 2:15), once as ""great"" (Gen. 30:8), and once as
""very great."" (1 Sam. 14:15)

        The word ""Jehovah"" is the traditional pronunciation of the
tetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word
""Adonai.""  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the
tetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since ""Jehovah"" rather
than Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use
""Jehovah"" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of
Mormon leaders regarding that name. ""Jehovah,"" unlike ""Elohim,"" is never
used of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the
Bible. In the KJV, ""Jehovah"" is rendered primarily ""LORD,"" sometimes
""GOD,"" and rarely ""Lord.""

        Now that we understand something about the words ""Elohim"" and
""Jehovah"" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle
McConkie's attack on Christians for believing the Father is ""Jehovah.""
In trying to prove that ""Jehovah"" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie
cited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie's
interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.
Remember, McConkie said the Father is not ""Jehovah;"" He is only
""Elohim."" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie's
interpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:

  ""Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit
  and he testified, ""The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right
  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?"" (Ps. 110:1.) Two
  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater
  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of
  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this
  Messianic prophecy?
  ""What think ye of Christ?"" our Lord asked certain of his detractors
  toward the end of his mortal ministry. ""Whose son is he?"" Is Christ
  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent
  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he
  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the
  Jews. And so they answered, ""The Son of David.""
  David's son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our
  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,
  asked, ""How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord
  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine
  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his
  son?"" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the
  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him
  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake
  unto David's Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is
  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: '_The
  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my
  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up
  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to
  sit on my right hand forever.' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)
  (emphasis added)

        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following
remark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6
reads: ""The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the
Son]..."" (brackets in original)

        McConkie clearly stated that it is ""Elohim"" the Father who is
speaking to ""Jehovah"" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at
the Hebrew word translated ""LORD,"" it becomes apparent that either the
first ""LORD"" is not the Father or else the Father is ""Jehovah."" Either
way McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:

  ""The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right
  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)

        The first ""LORD"" in this verse is ""Jehovah"" who Mormonism says
is Christ, not the Father. The second ""Lord"" is the Hebrew word ""Adon""
(singular for ""Adonai,"" meaning master or lord). If the first ""LORD"" is
the Father and the second ""Lord"" is the Son, then the Father is
""Jehovah"" and the Son is ""Adon."" However, if the Father is not ""Jehovah""
as McConkie claimed, then the first ""LORD"" is ""Jehovah"" the Son, but
who, then, is ""Adon?"" Obviously the Father is ""Jehovah"" in this Psalm,
and His Son is ""Adon.""

        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated
the following:

  ""I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,"" _Isaiah quoted the
  Father as saying of Christ_, ""and will hold thine hand, and will keep
  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the
  Gentiles."" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)

        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage
which reads:

  ""I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)

        According to McConkie, ""I the LORD"" refers to the Father, and
""thine"" and ""thee"" refer to Christ. However, the ""LORD"" who is speaking
is ""Jehovah"" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking
or else the Father is ""Jehovah.""

        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie
stated:

  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord
  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in
  him."" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is
  found in these words: ""The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes
  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be
  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will
  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which
  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth."" (Matt.
  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)

        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:

  ""All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they
  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would
  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment ""as Jesus hung
on the cross."" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was
Christ. Who, then, was the ""LORD"" in whom he trusted? It was ""Jehovah""
the Father.

        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,
McConkie stated the following:

  ""With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our
  Lord's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: ""They took counsel
  together against me, they devised to take away my life."" (Ps. 31:13.)
  ""Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me."" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised
  Messiah, p. 532)

        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ's ""arrest and
judicial trials."" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While
McConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included
to give a complete understanding of the matter.

  ""For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while
  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my
  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God
  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)

        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes
on to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the ""LORD"" who is called His
""God"" or ""Elohim."" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is
""Elohim"" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the ""Elohim"" of the
man Jesus is ""Jehovah"" the Father.

        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses
will be considered in this examination.

  ""Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my
  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that
  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)

        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas' role in
Christ's death. Since it was Judas who was the ""familiar friend"" who
""lifted up his heel,"" the pronouns ""mine,"" ""I,"" ""my,"" and ""me"" in verse
9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there
is a change of pronoun to ""thou,"" which refers to the ""LORD"" (Jehovah).
Then the pronouns ""me"" and ""I"" which refer to Christ are used again.
That means Christ was speaking to ""Jehovah"" the Father in these verses.

        Another example involves McConkie's following remark about Ps.
        110:4.

  ""One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,
  ever after the order of Melchizedek."" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,
  p. 450)

        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.
The question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?

  ""The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)

        Does the ""LORD,"" which is ""Jehovah,"" refer to Christ? If
McConkie is right and Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" but the Father is not, then
the ""LORD"" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one
addressed as the ""priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?"" The
Bible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;
6:20; 7); therefore, the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.

        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie
stated:

  ""Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...
     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....
     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)
     (emphasis added)

        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to ""the atoning
sacrifice of the future Messiah."" However, what he failed to mention is
that they also prove that the Father is ""Jehovah."" Verse 6 reads: ""All
we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;
and the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us
all,"" and verse 10 reads: ""Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise
him [Christ]...""

        Obviously the ""LORD"" who laid on Christ ""the iniquity of us all""
and who bruised Him is God the Father who is called ""Jehovah"" in these
verses.

        Remember, McConkie stated that ""some sectarians even believe
that Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,"" and that Christ ""came into
mortality"" as His ""Only Begotten"" Son. He called this concept
""misinformation"" that is ""untrue."" To prove that it is McConkie who is
misinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.
7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding
these Scriptures:

  ""In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of
  the Seed of David: ""I will be his father, and he shall be my son."" (2
  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly
  Messianic, occurs this statement: ""Thou art my Son; this day have I
  begotten thee."" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in
  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the
  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)

        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7
refer to Christ who ""would come as the Son of God."" Since McConkie first
referenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with
verse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.

  ""And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the
  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,
  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy
  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of
  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2
  Sam. 7:11-14)

        These verses teach that the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) would have a Son,
the Messiah.
        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination
will include verse 8. Notice that it is the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) who says,
""Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.""

  ""I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou
  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,
  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are ""clearly Messianic,""
and he acknowledged they teach that ""Christ would come as the Son of
God."" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these
Scriptures also teach that the Father is ""Jehovah"" and that the
""sectarians"" who believe ""Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son"" is
Jesus Christ, ""the Only Begotten,"" are right in their belief.

        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated
the following:

  ""And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,
  this is he of whom it is written_: ""He shall stand and feed in the
  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his
  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth."" (Mic.
  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)

        According to McConkie, the pronoun ""He"" at the beginning of Mic.
5:4 refers to Christ ""during his mortal ministry."" Who, then, is the
""LORD his God?"" Mic. 5:4 reads:

  ""And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD
  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God
  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

        Obviously the ""LORD"" of Jesus Christ is ""Jehovah"" the Father who
is referred to as ""Jehovah his Elohim.""

        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses
McConkie stated the following:

  ""A number of Messianic passages speak of ""the Lord, and...his
  anointed"" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated
  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus
  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah's prophecy. ""The
  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek"" (Isa.
  61:1), and then saying: ""This day is this scripture fulfilled in your
  ears"" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)

        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:

  ""The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel
  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.

        McConkie said the ""anointed"" one was Christ. If that is true,
who was ""Jehovah?"" If ""Jehovah"" is always Christ, who was the ""anointed""
one? Obviously ""Jehovah"" is referring to God the Father and the
""anointed"" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie
cited is Isa. 61:1 which states:

  ""The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the
  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;
  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to
  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;

        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open
was Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse
says the ""LORD"" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same
problem. If ""Jehovah"" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,
then Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, ""Jesus
applied these passages to himself."" Therefore, the ""Jehovah"" who
anointed Christ is God the Father.

        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other
Mormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not ""Jehovah.""
However, these should be enough to expose their error.

        Now, what about Mormonism's claim that Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" but
He is not ""Elohim?"" It is true that Jesus is ""Jehovah."" The following
Scriptures prove this fact:

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer
  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and
  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)
  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and
  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)

  ""...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have
  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only
  son... (Zech. 12:1,10)
  Behold, he [Christ] cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
  and they also which pierced him... (Rev. 1:7)

  ""...I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel... (Isa.
  43:3)
  ...Ye denied the Holy One [Christ] and the Just... (Acts 3:14)

  ""And it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of
  the LORD [Jehovah] shall be delivered... (Joel 2:32)
  ""...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name
  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)

  ""Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his
  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)
  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.
  22:12)

  ""...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with
  thee. (Zech. 14:5)
  ""...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints. (1
  Thess. 3:13)

  ""The LORD [Jehovah] is my shepherd... (Ps. 23:1)
  [Jesus said] I am the good shepherd... (John 10:14)

  ""...saith the Lord GOD [Jehovah]. I will seek that which was lost...
  (Ezek. 34:15-16)
  ...the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
  (Luke 19:10)

  ""For I am the LORD [Jehovah] thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
  Saviour... (Isa. 43:3)
  Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great
  God and our Saviour Jesus Christ. (Tit. 2:13. See also Jer. 42:5 and
  Rev. 1:5; Mal. 3:6 and Heb. 13:8; 1 Kin. 8:28,39 and John 2:24-25;
  Isa. 25:8 and 2 Tim. 1:10; Ps. 107:24,29 and Matt. 8:26; Prov.3:12 and
  Rev. 3:19)

        While Mormons are right when they say Jesus is ""Jehovah,"" they
are wrong when they say He is not ""Elohim."" The Bible reveals that
""Jehovah"" is the only true ""Elohim"" there is; all others are false.
Remember, ""Jehovah"" is the personal name of the triune God who has
revealed Himself in the Bible.

        Before we consider Biblical quotes which show that ""Jehovah"" and
""Elohim"" are not two separate gods as Mormons claims let us first note
that not only are both God the Father and Christ addressed as ""Jehovah""
and ""Elohim"" but so is the Holy Spirit.

  ""Whereof the _Holy Ghost_..._said_...This _is_ the covenant that I
  will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
  laws into their hearts, and in their minds will I write them; And
  their sins and iniquities will I remember no more. (Heb. 10:15-17)
  (emphasis on ""Holy Ghost"" and ""said"" added)
  Behold, the days come, _saith the LORD_ [Jehovah], that I will make a
  new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah...
  I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;
  and will be their God [Elohim], and they shall be my people.... I will
  forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. (Jer.
  31:31,33-34) (emphasis added)

  ""For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy
  men of God spake as they were moved by the _Holy Ghost_. (2 Pet. 1:21)
  (emphasis on ""Holy Ghost"" added)
  ""The Spirit of the LORD [Jehovah] spake by me, and his word was in
  my tongue. (2 Sam. 23:2. See also Heb. 3:7-11 with Ps. 95:6-11)

        Let us now continue with the Biblical quotes which show that
""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" are not two separate gods as Mormons claim.

  ""And when the LORD [Jehovah] saw that he [Moses] turned aside to see,
  God [Elohim] called unto him out of the midst of the bush, and said,
  Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I.... [Bruce R. McConkie
  acknowledged that ""it was"" Christ's ""voice that spoke to Moses in the
  burning bush..."" Promised Messiah, p. 394]
  And the LORD [Jehovah] said...
  And Moses said unto God [Elohim], Behold, when I come unto the
  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God [Elohim] of your
  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his
  name? what shall I say unto them?
  And God [Elohim] said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus
  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto
  you.
  And God [Elohim] said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto
  the children of Israel, the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of your
  fathers, the God [Elohim] of Abraham, the God [Elohim] of Isaac, and
  the God [Elohim] of Jacob, hath sent me unto you: this is my name for
  ever, and this is my memorial unto all generations. (Exod.
  3:4,7,13-15)

  ""And God [Elohim] spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the LORD
  [Jehovah]. (Exod. 6:2)

  ""I am the LORD [Jehovah], and there is none else, there is no God
  [Elohim] beside me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:
  (Isa. 45:5)

  ""But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God
  [Elohim], and an everlasting king... (Jer. 10:10)

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer
  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and
  beside me there is no God [Elohim]. (Isa. 44:6)

  ""Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus,
  saith the LORD [Jehovah], whose name is The God [Elohim] of hosts.
  (Amos 5:27)

  ""Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's
  [Jehovah's] thy God [Elohim], the earth also, with all that therein
  is. (Deut. 10:14)

  ""Wherefore thou art great, O LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim]: for there is
  none like thee, neither is there any God [Elohim] beside thee,
  according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 Sam. 7:22)

  ""And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD [Jehovah],
  the God [Elohim] of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.
  (Jon. 1:9)

  ""For who is God [Elohim] save the LORD [Jehovah]? or who is a rock
  save our God [Elohim]? (Ps. 18:31)

  ""Blessed is the nation whose God [Elohim] is the LORD [Jehovah]...
  (Ps. 33:12. See also Ps. 144:15)

  ""Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God
  [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah], the Creator of the ends of the earth,
  fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
  understanding. (Isa. 40:28)

  ""The mighty God [Elohim], even the LORD [Jehovah], hath spoken, and
  called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down
  thereof. (Ps. 50:1)

  ""Sing unto God [Elohim], sing praises to his name: estol him that
  rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him. (Ps.
  68:4) [Regarding the word ""Jah,"" Bruce R. McConkie stated: ""Jah
  (Hebrew Yah) is a contracted form of Jehovah, Jahveh, or Yahweh -- all
  of which names have reference to Christ, the God of Israel."" Mormon
  Doctrine, p. 391]

  ""And David arose, and went with all the people that were with him from
  Baale of Judah, to bring up from thence the ark of God [Elohim], whose
  name is called by the name of the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts that
  dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 Sam. 6:2)

  ""...the Great the Mighty God [Elohim], the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, is
  his name. (Jer. 32:18)

  ""O my God [Elohim], make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
  wind....
  Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD
  [Jehovah]....
  That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most
  high over all the earth. (Ps. 83:13,16,18)

        The Bible clearly teaches that ""Jehovah"" is ""Elohim."" In fact,
He is the only ""Elohim"" there is. He is the ""true,"" the ""living,"" the
""mighty,"" the ""great,"" and the ""everlasting Elohim."" He is the ""Elohim""
of Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is
the Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and
all that dwell thereon. ""Jehovah's"" name is ""Elohim of hosts."" (Amos
5:27)

        Not only is ""Jehovah,"" ""Elohim,"" but ""Elohim"" is ""Jehovah."" The
Bible reveals that ""Elohim's"" name is ""Jah"" (Ps. 68:4), ""Jehovah"" (Ps.
83:18), and ""Jehovah of hosts."" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation
whose ""Elohim"" is ""Jehovah"" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not
the ""Jehovah"" and ""Elohim"" of the Mormons.

        Another Mormon error regarding ""Elohim"" and ""Jehovah"" is the
belief that ""Elohim,"" not ""Jehovah,"" is the Father of all the spirits,
including Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,
""A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve"" apostles
states that ""God the Eternal Father...'Elohim,' is the literal Parent
of...the spirits of the human race."" (p. 466) This ""Doctrinal
Exposition"" also states explicitly that ""Jesus Christ is not the Father
of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,
for He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of
Elohim."" (p. 473)

        The Apostle Talmage stated that ""_Elohim_...is the name-title of
God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is
_Jehovah_--"" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)

        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this
matter: ""...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms
of plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to
placing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the
Father himself became personally involved. All things were created by
the Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the
spirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was
no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was
concerned."" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)

        Mormon leaders claim that ""Jehovah-Christ"" did not create either
man's spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon ""Elohim,"" who is
the father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the
truth about who created man.

  ""And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,
  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all
  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also
  16:20-23) (emphasis added)

  ""...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth
  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within
  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)

  ""...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)

  ""For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for
  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have
  made_....
  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on ""souls...I
  have made"" added)

  ""Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...
  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee
  from the womb_.
  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)
  (emphasis added)

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...
  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)
  (emphasis added)

  ""...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...
  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.
  4:32,35)

  ""Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the
  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the
  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)

  ""...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of
  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon
  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)

        The Bible reveals that it is ""Jehovah"" who is the ""Elohim of the
spirits of all flesh"" and ""of all flesh"" itself, that it was He who
""formed the spirit of man within him,"" that He ""made us this soul"" and
""formed us from the womb."" He did indeed ""create man.""

        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is ""Jehovah,""
then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are
right when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are
wrong when they say he is not ""Jehovah.""

        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,
Mormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:

  ""Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....
  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for
  never has man believed in me as thou hast....
  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and
  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)
  (emphasis added)

  ""For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I
  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)

  ""...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and
  all things that in them are.
  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)

        D&C, 93:10 states that ""the worlds were made by him [Christ];
_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,
and of him."" (emphasis added)

        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving ""Jehovah"" and his
creation is the belief that ""Jehovah"" had ""many"" pre-mortal spirits
helping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.

  ""That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by ""many of
  the noble and great"" spirit children of the Father is evident from
  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these
  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell."" (Abra.
  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,
  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other ""noble and
  great"" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines
  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)

        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:

  ""Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that
  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by
  myself. (Isa. 44:24)

  ""Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of
  the sea. (Job 9:8)

        ""Jehovah,"" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged
preexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.

        Regarding the Mormon 'Elohim,"" the Apostle McConkie stated:
""Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted
name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his
supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods."" (Mormon
Doctrine, p. 224) He also stated that ""Jesus...is above all save the
Father only."" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)

        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called
gods is the triune God ""Jehovah.""

  ""For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above
  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)

  ""For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art
  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)

  ""Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods
  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)

        If Mormon leaders are right when they say ""Jehovah"" is god the
son and ""Elohim"" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be
teaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie
clearly stated, Mormons believe ""Elohim"" the father, not ""Jehovah"" the
son, is the ""God above all Gods"" -- that Jesus is above all except the
father; yet the Bible teaches that ""Jehovah"" is above all ""Elohim.""

        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the
following remark about praying to Jesus:

  ""Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly
  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been
  developed....
  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the
  Father, and to him only....
  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;
  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With
  the Lord, pp. 19-20)

        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the
Mormons ""pray to the Father, not the Son..."" On p. 306 of the same book
McConkie states that ""Christ [the Son] is Jehovah."" This is important to
remember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to
the Mormon Christ who is ""Jehovah,"" the Bible states repeatedly in the
OT that people prayed to ""Jehovah,"" and He not only heard those prayers,
but He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small
sample of the vast number of times people prayed to ""Jehovah.""

  ""In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my
  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came
  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)

  ""And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this
  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine
  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)

  ""And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our
  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD
  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)

  ""O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to
  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)

  ""And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this
  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before
  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his
  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)

  ""He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed
  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)

  ""Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God
  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy
  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)

  ""I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I
  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and
  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.
  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)

        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the ""godly"" pray to ""Jehovah.""
According to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very
one to whom McConkie said people should not pray.

        The Bible reveals there is only one true ""Elohim,"" and His name
is ""Jehovah."" All other ""Elohim"" are false. They are idols that cause
their followers to commit adultery against the true ""Elohim"" and
idolatry.

  ""For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to
  be feared above all gods [Elohim].
  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD
  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)

  ""Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)

  ""Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods
  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)

  ""And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God
  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and
  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely
  perish. (Deut. 8:19)

  ""Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].
  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:
  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto
  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)

  ""Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn
  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)

  ""That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;
  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to
  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.
  (Josh. 23:7)

  ""...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)

  ""But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God
  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)

  ""And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,
  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods
  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about
  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]
  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)

  ""Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods
  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I
  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know
  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)

  ""And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you
  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your
  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods
  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my
  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].
  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should
  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.
  24:15-16)

        These verses teach that the only true, living ""Elohim"" in heaven
and on earth is ""Jehovah"" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth
and all therein.

        ""Jehovah"" is greater than any ""Elohim,"" because all other
""Elohim"" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)
""Jehovah Elohim"" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding
these false ""Elohim."" He told His people not to have any ""Elohim"" but
Him. He told the people that if they left Him for the false ""Elohim,""
those ""Elohim"" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and
would perish. He warned the people to ""take heed"" that their ""heart be
not deceived"" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making
covenants with false ""Elohim."" ""Jehovah Elohim"" told His people He would
eventually judge all false ""Elohim"" and their followers.

        Despite these warnings and guidelines, ""Elohim's"" covenant
people forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false ""Elohim's"" of
the people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that ""the children
of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served
Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods
[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]
of the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and
forsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.""

        This examination has shown that the ""Elohim"" of Mormonism, like
the ""Elohim"" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true ""Jehovah Elohim."" Therefore,
the people who leave the true ""Elohim"" for the Mormon ""Elohim"" will do
""evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].""

        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a
triune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father
[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is
triune; He is Spirit; He is ""Jehovah;"" and He did send His Son into the
world to redeem mankind.

        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the
Christians who ""thrash around in...darkness"" about who ""Elohim"" and
""Jehovah"" are. One wonders what ""Holy Writ"" McConkie had in mind when he
stated that it attests to the fact that ""Elohim is the Father, and that
Jehovah is the Son."" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches
that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one ""Jehovah Elohim.""
He apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses
1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as
""Jehovah.""

Summary

        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith's statement that the Mormons
""have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God"" (Doctrines
of Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true
God as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to
commit adultery against God and idolatry.

        In answer to Jesus' question, ""But whom say ye that I am,""
Mormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in
the Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in
the Mormon Jesus is believing in ""another Jesus"" whom Paul warned about.

        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,
admitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that
the Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that
""it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different
Jesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints."" (p. 26)

        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing
adultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,
they do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the
Apostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: ""Salvation comes only by
worshiping the true God."" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also
rightly stated that ""the mere worship of a god who has the proper
scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and
living God,"" because the ""true names of Deity"" can be applied to ""false
concepts of God."" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle
Stephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave ""a new
conception of God and the Godhead."" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.
1)

        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God
revealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the
sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.

  ""...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from
  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD
  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)

  ""And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God
  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and
  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely
  perish. (Deut. 8:19)

  ""Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)

  ""...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be
  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)

  ""...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)

        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.
If they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and
idolatry. Remember, to know the ""only true God"" is eternal life. (John
17:3)",3

I hope there is not one- with a subject like this you just have a spiral.  What
would then be a morality of a morality of morals.  Labels don't make arguments. 
One really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be
interpreted, even though this would hardly seem moral.  For example ""The best
thing for me is to ensure that I will eat and drink enough.  Hence all actions
must be weighed against this one statement.""  whatever helps this goal is
""moral"", whatever does not is ""immoral""

Of course this leads such a blank space: there are so many different ways to
fulfill a goal, one would need a ""hyper-morality"" to apply to just the methods.


Seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think
about it long enough  :)  On the other hand, maybe it is our first gut
reaction...  Which?  Who knows: perhaps here we have a way to discriminate
morals.  I don't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way I
instinctively feel torture is wrong), but if I thought about it long enough and
listened to the arguments, I could perhaps reason that it was wrong (is that
possible!?  :) )  See the difference?

Apparently you *didn't* read the whole thing.  You continue to miss the point.



[deletions]



Counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as
biased as counselling that only provides *abortion* information.  How about
providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what *she* is
comfortable with.

Your adoption-funding idea may be a good one.  Any idea if it is feasable?




Making adoption easier on the birth-mother may help reduce abortion, but
it will *not* eliminate the need for it.  Abortion is not done just because
the mother can't care for the child and doesn't feel good about giving it
to strangers.  Abortion is done because the mother can not afford the
*pregnancy*.







Then please justify why being ""human"" automatically makes something valuable.
And why that includes the unborn.




No, they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society.  Even
if they do that is *MANY YEARS* in the future--until which they are a burden
on someone, or society.  There is also the matter of the mother.  Forcing
her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent
her from being a productive member of society.






Ok, look.  It's like this.  We *are* footing the bill.  Maybe they will
take choice A.  Maybe they will take choice B.  Maybe they will take choice
C.  They can't afford any *one* of them.  If they take choice A we'd have
to pay them, say $5.  If they take choice B it would cost us $20.  If they
take choice C it will cost us $20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next
18 years.  Which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay
for?  Now some people happen not to like choice A.  Other people happen
not to like choice C (paying for it, that is).  C has been around and paid
for for years.  Even though it means we spend a lot of money, we can't in
conscience refuse to pay for it.  Now A has been around and is perfectly
legal, but it hasn't been funded in the past.  Now A is going to be funded
but some people object.  They don't like the idea of their tax money going
to pay for choice A.  So we could refuse to fund A at all.  Then those
women who can't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice
B or C, which will cost *all of us* more money.  Most of us don't see any
reason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing
personal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is
what the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*
is what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,
and that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your
""taxes"" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being
*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your
objections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,
as I'm sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that
area can help out in another--like our massive debt.)





Those other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings
in other procedures that would be required down the road without them.
(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)
This is quite different from the case of abortion.


This is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing ""to make the alternative affordable
too"".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*
your statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn't.
If Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left
it out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be
quite surprised.



Yes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.


YOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the
one who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.


Your humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still
the fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman
could need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering
college, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to
do if you have to ""take a break"" for a few months...things that have a massive
impact on her future productivity.)




You *can* have a conversation with the ""mentally incompetant"".  And even
though *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with ""people
you just don't like"", it is still *possible* for others to have a conversation
with them.  It is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with
a fetus.



He was still biologically independent.  At least to the same extent you are
now.  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  He
breathed his own air.  A fetus on the other hand, gets it's nutrients already
digested by the mother.  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  That
is not biologically independent.



Awareness is only *part* of what makes a ""member of society"".  It is the
minimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that something
without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing
of a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven't seen a real
justification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the
suffering of a sentient being.  (I haven't read every response on the threads
I've been asking on, yet, so we'll see if I see one later.)

(about my reply)


It a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy
is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn't it?


Kevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little
about, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the
lines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot
be algorithmic in his book _The emperor's new mind: Concerning
computers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose's
claim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim
that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,
could be just illusions.

We are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,
realising that it might not be anything special, but certainly
useful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds
or not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave 
just like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day
in the future perform a ""total synthesis of C. elegans"" from
the elements. Would such a worm have a mind?


This is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains
work like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence
(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less
chaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.
Our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.


Indeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture
on our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. 

Kevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.
I still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind
are neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not 
flame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are
conscious. 

The reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot
lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.

And please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not
all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness
plays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn't.


Again, _brains are not computers_. Don't forget this. This does not
mean they need something else to work - they just work differently.
Their primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action, 
self-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.


You are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in
our brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is
not how I see it. The sensation 'green' is a certain time-dependent
pattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed
with the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. 

Indeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness
as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,
but this is just idle speculation.

Scientific American's September 1992 issue was a special issue on
mind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)
There are two articles on visual perception, so you might be 
interested.

But again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be 
observed from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but 
neuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the
mind.

Kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation
of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the 
patients' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area
was stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during
a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and
started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.

Stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing
situations, when the patients have started flirting with the
therapist.

In conclusion, there is evidence that

1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, 
   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage

2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in
   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our
   visual cortex is activated etc.

3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our
   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead
   of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms. 

Thus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question ""Why do 'I' see
colours"" around and ask ""What is this 'I' that seems to be 
observing?"", since it seems that our conscious mind is not
the king of our brains.


This depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours'. Does a neural
network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from
0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?

If you are asking, ""why does an animal who is conscious of itself
as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who
doesn't"", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,
where I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap
roles and act more morally, so that they don't unconsciously
kill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,
but this is the basic idea.)

When early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, 
a sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in
line with this development. Indeed, respect for others and 
conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages
for social animals, such as early humans. 


If minds are required for this, does this mean that until human
minds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained
in the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.

This has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,
since we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do
physicists. 


I agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics
needs sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)

I think you're both right.  Teflon was actually discovered by accident
before WWII.  From what I've heard, they had some chemical (I assume it
was tetrafluoroethylene) in a tank and but the valve got gummed up.
Cutting it open revealed that it had polymerized.

The material was useful for seals, but it had a major problem for, say
the linings of vessels: it wouldn't stick to metal.  What the space
program did was to find a way to get it to stick.  Thus we had no-stick
frypans on the market in the late '60s.

But I believe that there is a fundamental difference here.  The other x
three instruments are focusing instruments, that, more or less, form
an image, so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the 
resolving power of the optics.  BATSE is an altogether different
beast, effectively just 8 coincidence counters, one on each corner of 
the craft.  Positional information is triangulated from the 
differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors.
Positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors
and errors in craft attitude. Since none of the 8 BASTE detectors have
any independant angular resolution whatsoever, they can not be used to
determine parallax.  Indeed, parallax would just add a very small 
component to the positional error.  

Demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would 
require resolution on the order of arcseconds, since the oort 
cloud is postulated to extend to about 0.5 parsec (all together 
now: ""Parallax ARc SECond"", a parsec is the distance of an object 
that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 AU base line).
If the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true, we're going to 
have to add a BASTE to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline.

The beauty of BASTE is that it both gives positional information and
watches the entire sky simultaneously, a realy handy combination

"        I had to turn to one of my problem sets that I did in class for this
little problem.  I don't have a calculator, but I DO have the problem set that
we did not too long ago, so I'll use that, and hope it's what you wanted.  
This is a highly simplified problem, with a very simple burst.  Bursts are
usually more complex than this example I will use here.
        Our burst has a peak flux of 5.43E-6 ergs cm^-2 sec^-1 and a duration
of 8.95 seconds.  During the frst second of the burst, and the last 4 seconds,
its flux is half of the peak flux.  It's flux is the peak flux the rest of the
time.  Assume that the background flux is 10E-7 erg cm^-2 sec^-1.
        Then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst, for several
different spheres: R=.25pc(Oort Cloud Radius), R=22.5pc(at the edge of the
galaxy), R=183.5pc or the edge of the galactic corona, and lastly at a
R=8800Mpc.  
        We integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence, then used the
old standby formula:
                        Luminosity=4(pi)(r^2)Fpeak
        For a radius of .25 pc, we found an L around 10^32 erg/sec.  Pretty
energetic for close by.  for the coronal model, we found around 10^43 erg/sec.
And lastly, for the cosmological model an L=10^53. That's what you'd call
moderately energetic, I'd say.  Any suggestions about what could put out that
much energy in one second?

I have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.

# 
#The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes

#because of the special features of theistic belief.

Truth by blatant assertion.  Evidence?

#You, Frank O'Dwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any

# 
#To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.

The onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say
one thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it's there
for anyone to see.  It's almost an epidemic in this country.

Just for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye
of a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why
are there churches to the square inch in my country?

#>
# 
#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already
#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and
#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them
#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the
#theology.

Truth by blatant assertion.  
# 
# 
#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.
#>
#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,
#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed

#>
# 
#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people
#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the
#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you
#challenged.

Indeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation
of which you speak?

#

# 
#Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights
#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.

Of course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your
wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.
# 
#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between

OK, never heard of Cross filters, but Roberts, Prewitt and Sobel filters
are standard spatial masks for edge detection.  Highpass filtering does a
good job of detecting edges, too.  A good reference for all sorts of general
digital image processing is the book _Digital Image Processing_ by
Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods.  Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. 1992.

Of course,

	How many government projects after Using PERT, GANT, C.P.M.s
Process flow diagrams,  Level 5 software projects....  actually
come in on schedule and under Cost.  I know the GAO determined
that 80% of all NASA projects  miss their budgets due to failing
to adequately measure  engineering developement costs.   

Me, I am allin favor of Government R&D.  I thought Bell Labs was one of the best 
to do research.   I don't think the government should pour money
into any one sector,  but should engage in projects which naturally
push the state of the art.  

THings like  High tech  construction projects,  apollo  was worth it for the doing.  Running hte national labs.  The SSC is grossly overweight,  but
is a reasonable project at a lower cost.  

Unfortunately support for solo investigators is direly neglected.

Maybe what they should do, is throw out much of the process and just tell
new PH'ds,  you get a 1 time grant of $50,000.00   If you produce, you
can  qualify for other grants.  If you don't  you never get in again.

THis way  young people get a shot at  reserach,  and older  stale 
scientists don't dominate the process.",2

Certainly. Reference follows. 

Bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
red/green colour blind. One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long
wavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.

The other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.
It also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. 
Unlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.

On a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red
corner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31

Note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.

So if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?

This problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on
the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is
very similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.

*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia:

1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
4) This is the new chromaticity. 

The best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P. (1988) 'Colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays', IEEE Computer Graphics and
Applications 8(5) 28-40.

You will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the CIE XYZ colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.


Yes this is certainly possible. You will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and
the chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or
obtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago.

The procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a
help here.)

A) convert RGB to CIE XYZ. This is a simple 3*3 matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data.
B) retaining the Y component for later, convert XYZ to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u' = 4X/(X+15Y+3Z), v' = 9Y/(X+15Y+3Z)
C) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above
D) find the intersection as in step 3
E) convert back from u'v' to XYZ, using the Y value from step A
F) Ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor; if not, move it
along a line in XYZ space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and
white) until it is displayable.


Done; also posted for the rest of us.

In his infinite wisdom, he made it perfectly clear that if we don't live

make that desicion? Let's say, for the sake of argument, that god creates every

that he first creates us, and then turns us lose. Well, I didn't ask to be

Let's make an analogue. If a scientist creates a unique living creature (which

expect it to behave in a certain matter, or die...?

Slower:  The shuttle mission is scheduled to go up in December.  That's less
than eight months away.  There is no way you could build new hardware, retrain
and reschedule the EVA's in that time.

More Expensive:  Your proposal still requires the shuttle to do everything it

extra cost for a new piece of complex hardware.


According to a GAO report on the OMV I have before me, there are

Since this is alt.atheism, I hope you don't mind if we strongly disagree...

: The fact is God could cause you to believe anything He wants you to. 
: But think about it for a minute.  Would you rather have someone love
: you because you made them love you, or because they wanted to
: love you.     The responsibility is on you to love God and take a step toward
: Him.  He promises to be there for you, but you have to look for yourself.

Indeed, ""knock and it shall be opened to you"". Dan, why didn't this work?
I firmly believed in god for 15 years, but I eventually realised I was
only deluding myself, fearful to face the truth. Ultimately, the only reason
what kept me believing was the fear of hell. The mental states I 
had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil's attempts to 
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination, and it is easy
to achieve the same mental states at will. 

My faith was just learned fear in a disguise.

: Those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.

God is demanding too much. Dan, what was it I believed in for 15 years?
If sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief -
what it was in my case - I'd rather quit. If god does not help me to
keep the faith, I can't go on. 

Besides, I am concerned with god's morality and mental health. Does
she really want us to _believe_ in herself without any help (revelations,
guidance, or anything I can feel)? If she has created us, why didn't
she make the task any easier? Why are we supposed to love someone who
refuses to communicate with us? What is the point of eternal torture
for those who can't believe?

I love god just as much as she loves me. If she wants to seduce me,
she'll know what to do. 

: Simple logic arguments are folly.  If you read the Bible you will see
: that Jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with ""logic"".
: Our ability to reason is just a spec of creation.  Yet some think it is
: the ultimate.  If you rely simply on your reason then you will never
: know more than you do now. 

Your argument is of the type ""you'll know once you try"".
Yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried, and believed
for many years, but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
they had lived in a virtual reality.

What else but reason I can use? I don't have the spiritual means 
Christians often refer to. My conscience disagrees with the Bible.
I don't even believe I have a soul. I am fully dependent on my
body - indeed, I _am_ this body. When it goes up with flames, so
does my identity. God can entertain herself with copies of me
if she wants.

: To learn you must accept that which you don't know.

What does this mean? To learn you must accept that you don't know 
something, right-o. But to learn you must _accept_ something I don't
know, why? This is not the way I prefer to learn. It is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read. Suppose I write a book telling
how the Great Invisible Pink Unicorn (tm) has helped me in my
daily problems, would you accept this, since you can't know whether
it is true or not?

Note that the GIPU is also omnipotent, omnipresent, and loves just
about everyone. Besides, He (and She) is guiding every writer on this planet,
you and me, and not just some people who write legendary stories
2000 years ago.

Your god is just one aspect of His and Her Presence.

I'm worried by the concern about it though, for a number of reasons
that have nothing to do with Space Advertising (which for a number of
reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds).

(And I've been reading and (and writing) this thread since way
back when it was only on sci.space).

For starters, I don't think the piece of light-pollution apparatus
would be as bright as the full moon. _That_ seems to me to be a bit
of propaganda on the part of opponents, or wishful thinking on the
part of proponents.

Second, this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been
levelled against other projects, that either 1) don't increace light
pollution significantly, or 2) increace light pollution only over the
target area.

You may or may not recognize #1 as being Solar Power Sattelites.
I think it was Josh Hopkins who actually did the math, showing that
SPS's weren't that bright after all, ending some two months of frenzied
opposition on the part of dark-sky activists and various other types.

#2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the CIS tested
recently.  While slightly more worrisome, I'd like to point out that
any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of
these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be
concerned, and something any project like that would work against
anyway. And given some of the likely targets, I don't think there's
going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants. There is too much
dark sky in the northern CIS during the winter, and I doubt you'll find
many activists in Murmansk demanding the ""natural"" sky back. If anything,
he'll probably be inside, stripped buck naked in front of the UV lamp,
making sure he'll get enough vitamin D for the ""day.""

The mirror experiments aren't something they're doing for crass
advertising. They think that if they can build one, it'll be one of
those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn't
have lived without before. And I doubt anyone's going to really be
able to convince them to stop.

HST is about 25,500 lbs (11,600 kg).  That doesn't include the cradle that

it is precisely the Khomeini's of the world, the Rushdie-fatwa

unfortunately from your perspective, most people are not concerned
with whether Islam is the right religion for them, or whether the

His answer, ""I don't know.""

This, & the posting above highlights one of the worst things about

their believe is both illogical & irrational.  Their tactics, therefore:
to disregard logic & rationality altogether.  Silly excuses such as
the ones above and those such as, ""How can u trust science, science
was invented by man!"", only goes to further show the weakness of
their religion.

In my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing, xtains
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.
They know it would be a fruitless act, given the irrational nature
of their faith.
They would wait until a person is in distress, then they would comfort
him/her and addict them to their emotional opium.

Never in my life had I met a person who converted to xtainity coz it's
""reasonable"".  Rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement

"Hi there,
        I'm using POv-Ray on my IBM compatible at home, but I would like to 
run some things at work on our VAX computer. I believe there is a version 
of the source code for POV-ray that is VAX specific, but I'm not sure where 
to find it (I've looked at the several sites where the IBMPC version of it 
can be found). Can anyone help me?

Thanks in advance,",1
"I was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the PC that
will do compositing of a series of pictures?

What I mean by ""compositing"" is, say I have a live video clip
(digitized) panning around a living room, and a computer-generated
bird flying around the screen.  I want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black, I want
the living room picture to show through.  Yes, I realize I can do this
with a genlock, and I do own a genlock, but I want to be able to do
manual compositing also.  It's ok if I have to composite one frame at
a time; I assumed I'd have to do that anyway.  But being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better.",1

When he asked for this book, the well educated American book store
assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section,
or then they said that his book has not been published yet, but they
should receive the book soon. In some places the assistants bluntly
said that they don't know of such an author, or that he is not

    Yes.  There are many methods of rendering, raytracing is one of them.
You didn't say what you mean by rendering, so I won't guess.  Methods of
rendering include:

        o  Pencil and graph paper, doing the math by hand

        o  Wireframe rendering of the 2D projection

        o  Hidden line rendering

        o  Scanline rendering using:
            - Painter's algorithm.

"Re; Response from CoB of Boeing on SSTO ...
  
   Boeing has been looking at several TSTO vehicles and has carried
out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some
time.  A good reference on this might be: ""Comparison of Propulsion
Options for Advanced Earth-To-Orbit (ETO) Applications (IAF-92-
0639)."" by V.A. Weldon and L.E. Fink from Boeing.   The paper
describes a propane-fueled TSTO launch system claimed to achieve
aircraft-like operational efficiencies without the problems
associated with liquid hydrogen fuel.  Basically, it's a high-speed
airplane launching a Hermes-type spaceplane
   The design (the concept is also called ""Beta"") as laid out in the
paper can launch at least 10,000 pounds into polar orbit, or 20,000
pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and
life support.  System design reliability is .9995.
   Beta is a 360-foot-long first stage powered by two large ramjets
and 12 high- speed civil transport (HSCT) turbofans.  A 108-foot-
long reusable orbiter is trapeze-mounted in the belly of the first-
stage aircraft, which also could accommodate a longer and heavy
payload on an expendable second stage.
   To launch the orbital vehicle, the first stage takes off like a
normal HSCT and accelerates to Mach 3.  At that point the turbofans,
modified to burn catalyzed JP-7, would shut off and the ramjets,
would take over.  At Mach 5.5 the orbiter or the ELV would swing
out, ignite and proceed to orbit. Both vehicles would land like
aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions.
   Estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff
is about 1.5 M lbs, roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded An-225.
The orbiter stages weighs about 400,Klbs including 335 Klbs
of LOX and subcooled propane to power two 250 Klbs vacuum thrust
rocket engines. Propellants would be stored at 91 degrees Kelvin,
with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15-by-
25-foot cargo bay and the two-seat orbiter crew station. LOX would
be stored aft.  Weldon and Fink claim the key to this design's
success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact
tankage allowed by the high-density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel.
     The paper compares TSTO design to SSTO design.  They conclude
while a SSTO has a slightly lower recurring cost, a TSTO is easier,
cheaper, and less risky to develop, simpler to build, has greater
safety and mission versatility and doesn't carry the hard-to-handle
and bulky hydrogen fuel. The conlcude ""In conjunction with its major
use of airplane type engines and fuel, as well as its inherent self-
ferry capability, it is probably the system most likely to provide
as close to airline-like operations as possible with a practical
configuration, until a single stage airbreather/rocket concept can
be shown to be operationally viable.""
  
   Weldon and others at Boeing have been working on TSTO designs for
some time.  I expect this, or a similar concept (perhaps the HTHL
SSTO they proposed for the SDIO SSTO first phase) is being re-
examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of SpaceLifter.
   Does it threaten DC-???.  Possibly -- There is a set of on-going
studies trying straighten out the government's future space
transportation strategy.  MDC and Boeing (as well as other firms)
are providing data to a joint study team back in DC.  There are
various factions and options vying for attention -- including
shuttle upgrades, shuttle replacement (what was called the ""4-2-3""
architecture), SpaceLifter, ELV upgrades, and various advanced
vehicles (ALES, Beta, DC-??, NASP, FSTS, SSTOs of several types,
etc.)  NASA/DOD/DOT are trying to put together a coherent strategy
for future US gov't space transportation systems, and trying to
juggle near-term launch needs (like for DoD and NASA) against
medium-term needs (including commercial considerations), and against
the investment and risk of going to ""leap frog"" new technologies
like SDIO/SSTO and NASP and Beta.
   It's a heck of a problem.  The worst part of the problem isn't
that there aren't promising ideas and concepts -- there are dozens
of them -- but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in
the near term.  They should have a draft report in mid-June, with a
final report coming by the end of the fiscal year.

"Hello Ceci:

     My name is Tony and I have a few comments on your ""rosicrucian""
adventure. I hereby state that I am not claiming or denying membership in
any Order, fraternity etc. with or without the word ""Rosicrucian"" in the 
name of the organization. I only claim having done some ""homework"" :-)

     This is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems
different, it's my lack of writing skills showing, nothing else. Heck,
English may be my second language! (And then again maybe not by now :-)

     I proceed:
     Let's start with the name ""Rosicrucian"". I took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a
""rosicrucian"" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met
some 'rosicrucians' you mean ""members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian"". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)

     I'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium
Rosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this
newsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in
San Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I
looked). Of course, ""most members"" does not *necessarily* mean ""best"".

     Anyway, the Lectorium Rosicrucianum claims they
descend (at least in part) from what was the ""Gold-und-Rosenkreuz"" (Golden
and Rosy Cross), from the 18th century. There were two ""Golden and Rosy
Cross"", the first (chronologically) more alchemical, the second with
Masonic tinges, but their history is the subject of a complete chapter :-).

     ""You'll have to trust me"" when I tell you that if that
lecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression, i.e., you'd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. 

     Again, instead of R:s, it should be ""Lectorium Rosicrucianum"" :-). It
is curious to know that 3 other RC 'orders' (in the USA) claim to be *non-
sectarian*.

     The Cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged
the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. They flourished during the
12th century, century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the
crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the
worldly ways of its clerics. It was largely in response to the church's
unseemly pomp and splendor that Catharism took root, first in northern
Italy, then throughout the south of France.



     I don't see nothing *fundamentally* wrong with ""us containing
something divine""... And yes I don't like phrases like ""eternal bliss""
either! :-)

     For a moment I thought you were referring to Madison Ave :-)

$$$) *commercial* advertising is produced here in the USA :-)

          ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North 
          Pacific Publishers, Portland, Oregon, 456 pages, indexed, 
          hardcover. 
          

               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to 
          most ALL astrophysical mysteries. 
          
               This book is Volume III of a revised and enlarged 
          edition of ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"", 1959.  
          Volume I is ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979), and Volume II is 
          ""THE BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988). 
          
               Most books and journal articles on the subject of 
          astrophysics are bristling with integrals, partial 
          differentials, and other FANCY MATHEMATICS.  In this book, by 
          contrast, mathematics is conspicuous by its absence, except 
          for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text.  
          Larson emphasizes CONCEPTS and declares that mathematical 
          agreement with a theory does NOT guarantee its conceptual 
          validity. 
          
               Dewey B. Larson was a retired engineer with a Bachelor 
          of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State 
          University.  He developed the Theory described in his books 
          while trying to find a way to MATHEMATICALLY CALCULATE the 
          properties of chemical compounds based ONLY on the elements 
          they contain. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" describes the astrophysical 
          portions of Larson's CONSISTENT, INTEGRATED, COMPREHENSIVE, 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, a kind of 
          ""grand unified field theory"" that orthodox physicists and 
          astro-physicists CLAIM to be looking for.  It is built on two 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of 
          space and time: 
          
               (1) The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          units, and with two RECIPROCAL aspects, SPACE and TIME. 
          
               (2) The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its primary magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN. 
          
               From these two postulates, Larson was able to build a 
          COMPLETE theoretical universe, from photons and subatomic 
          particles to the giant elliptical galaxies, by combining the 
          concept of INWARD AND OUTWARD SCALAR MOTIONS with 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and rotational-
          vibrational motions.  At each step in the development, he was 
          able to match parts of his theoretical universe with 
          corresponding parts in the real physical universe, including 
          EVEN THINGS NOT YET DISCOVERED.  For example, in his 1959 
          book, he first predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, 
          several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They 
          are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of his comprehensive Theory.  And 
          when quasars were discovered, he had a related explanation 
          ready for those also. 
          
               As a result of his theory, which he called ""THE 
          RECIPROCAL SYSTEM"", Larson TOTALLY REJECTED many of the 
          sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists, 
          including black holes, neutron stars, degenerate matter, 
          quantum wave mechanics (as applied to atomic structure), 
          ""nuclear"" physics, general relativity, relativistic mass 
          increases, relativistic Doppler shifts, nuclear fusion in 
          stars, and the big bang, all of which he considered to be 
          nothing more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES.  He was very 
          critical of the AD HOC assumptions, uncertainty principles, 
          solutions in principle, ""no other way"" declarations, etc., 
          used to maintain them. 
          
               ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" is divided into 31 chapters.  
          It begins with a description of how galaxies are built from 
          the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters, 
          which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that 
          accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in 
          from the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe.  (Galaxy 
          formation from the MYTHICAL ""big bang"" is a big mystery to 
          orthodox astronomers.)  He then goes on to describe life 
          cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and 
          solar systems result from Type I supernova explosions of 
          SINGLE stars. 
          
               Several chapters are devoted to quasars which, according 
          to Larson, are densely-packed clusters of stars that have 
          been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies 
          and are actually traveling FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT 
          (although most of that speed is AWAY FROM US IN TIME). 
          
               Astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against 
          observations that contradict their theories would find 
          Larson's explanations quite valuable if considered with an 
          OPEN MIND.  For example, they used to believe that GAMMA RAY 
          BURSTS originated from pulsars, which exist primarily in the 
          plane or central bulge of our galaxy.  But the new gamma ray 
          telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from 
          ALL DIRECTIONS UNIFORMLY and do NOT correspond with any 
          visible objects, (except for a few cases of directional 
          coincidence).  Larson's explanation is that the gamma ray 
          bursts originate from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER 
          HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""cosmic 
          sector"".  Because the anti-matter universe exists in a 
          RECIPROCAL RELATION to our material universe, with the speed 
          of light as the BOUNDARY between them, and has THREE 
          dimensions of time and ONLY ONE dimension of space, the 
          bursts can pop into our material universe ANYWHERE seemingly 
          at random. 
          
               Larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from 
          books, journal articles, and leading physicists and 
          astronomers.  In this book, 351 of them are superscripted 
          with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the 
          end of the book.  For example, a quote from the book 
          ""Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey"", by William K. Hartmann, 
          says, ""Our hopes of understanding all stars would brighten if 
          we could explain exactly how binary and multiple stars 
          form.... Unfortunately we cannot.""  Larson's book contains 
          LOGICAL CONSISTENT EXPLANATIONS of such mysteries that are 
          WORTHY OF SERIOUS CONSIDERATION by ALL physicists, 
          astronomers, and astrophysicists.

Jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the Law, and, unless
I'm mistaken, heaven and earth have not yet passed away. Am I mistaken?
And, even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word
of Jesus, do you really think that ""all is accomplished?""


Then why didn't Jesus say ""Any Jew who annuls ..."" in v. 19? Are you
saying that all of Jesus' recorded words mean nothing to Gentiles? Are
you really saying that Jesus only spoke for and to the Jews? Jesus
didn't mention your name, does that mean he wasn't speaking to you? When
you read the words of Jesus, do you think he is speaking to someone
other than you?


You said above that Jesus was the ""fulfillment"" of the Law. Are you
saying that does not mean ""doing away with the Law""?


Gen3:15(JPS) I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between
your offspring and hers; they shall strike at your head, and you shall
strike at their heel.

Gen3:15(NRSV) I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
offspring and hers; he will strike your head, and you will strike his
heel.""

Gen3:15(KJV) And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and
between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt
bruise his heel.

Looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the Word?


Only ""helping the Jewish people?""


You are using your interpretation of Paul as an argument against the
clear words of Jesus?


""Re-expressed?"" Care to define that a bit better?


What? Are heaven and earth gone away? Where did they go? Is all
accomplished, for example Revelations? Explain please.


Again, your interpretation of Paul versus the clear word of Jesus. Do
you see any problems here? When did heaven and earth go away? When was
all accomplished?",3

   Henry, if I read you correctly, you may be asking ""If I put a blackbody

what termperature will it reach in thermal equilibrium with the ambient

   If that's the case, let me point out that interstellar dust and 
molecules provide many instances of things that are, well, not-too-far
from being blackbodies.  Many different observations, including IRAS
and COBE, have determined that interstellar dust grain temperatures
can range from 40K to 150K.  You might look in a conference proceedings

I don't see yours.  It seems to rest on the assertion that everything
is either a subject or an object.  There's nothing compelling about that
dichotomy.  I might just as well divide the world into subject,object,
event.  It even seems more sensible.  Causation, for example, is
an event, not a subject or an object.  

Furthermore, if subject/object were true dichotomy, i.e.

	Everything is either a subject or an object

Then, is that statement a self-evident truth or not?  If so, then it's 
all in the mind of the beholder, according to the relativist, and hardly 
compelling.  Add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved
in its entirety into the ""subjective"" category by an idealist or 
solipsist argument, and that we have this perfectly good alternate
set of categories (subject, object, event) [which can be reduced
to (subject, object, quality) without any logical difficulty] and why
yes, I guess I *am* denying that self-evident truths are all in the mind of 
the beholder.

#>>If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?

All of it.

#This makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the

#believed in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the
#People.

I'm referring to ethical nihilism

#>>The subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are

God never changes.  He still loves us.  Sending Jesus was one of His
attempts to reconcile with mankind.  The nature of God has not changed.


Sinning in the face of God was punishable by immediate death.  There are
several OT passages to back this up.  God is God.  He cannot tolerate
the prescence of sin in His midst.  And the Israelites knew this!  And
still, some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed.  Were these
people KIND and LOVing themselves?  God gave them every break He could
but in the end, He really had no choice in the matter.  Seeing as how
we were failing to achieve salvation on our own, He sent His Son to die
for us - to be the ultimate sin offering.  Now we live in the age of
grace.



He sent His Son as a consolation to us, out of love.
 

Hey, let's be fair for a moment here.  KIND and LOVING does not mean
a free ride.  There is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.
Parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that 
children can do whatever they want?  NOT!  Part of being a parent means
administering punishment when the child is at fault.  Part of being a 
parent means giving instruction.  God tests us through the trial of
life such that we may grow stronger.  He teaches what is right and 
what is wrong.  The consequences of our actions are made clear to us,
be it Heaven or be it Hell.  If God did not follow through with what
He has warned us about, He would not be a very good parent.

In parenting, if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through
with it, the children will not take that parent's words very seriously.
God does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and
what not to do.  By life's trials, we see the folly of doing our own
will rather than His.  He warns us about the consequences of rejecting
Him when it comes time for Judgement.  Do we follow Him?

I will.

Peace be with you,

Malcolm Lee  :)

Watch me. It flies. It lands. It gets rebuilt.



That's not what they told us back in the '70's.


1. It isn't a logical follow-on. A logical follow-on would have
been either a Russian ""snowfox"" type thingey (for the lifting bodies)
or something like MMI's Space Van (or Boeing's TSTO, or the airbreathing
TSTO the military is allegedly _using_ now that probably cost less
to develop than the shuttle does to fly for a year).


Keep that attitude, and it'll be a couple centuries before we get real
access to space, unless another country without all that baggage comes
along and kicks our ass in the space race.


Or NASA HQ. That doesn't give the rest of the program plausible deniability
if we deceide that it wasn't worth the money we've spent, which is by now
probably a lot more than Apollo.


Yes, but it gets sold on the basis of the political statements.
You're saying basically that it met the engineering specs (which is
questionable, IMHO) so it's a success, never mind that you couldn't
get the funding the shuttle eats with those engineering specs in
a thousand years.


You can get hypersonic flight data with an X-15 or a follow-on X-15
type vehicle for much less.

And economics and engineering are interchangable; engineering in the
absense of economics is basically just physics, and in terms of physics,
the shuttle looks like a failure next to the X-15.



HS>Sorry, support that I can arrange for launchers all goes to launchers
HS>that I have some hope of riding some day.  At the moment, that's
HS>DC-X's hoped-for successors.


The shuttle program has a bad record. I _once_ had hopes for the
shuttle program. By now I know those hopes were false. 

All I have for DC-X and similar and dissimilar experimental vehicles
are hopes. But at least I know they aren't false hopes yet.

I did support the shuttle, way back when. It didn't do nearly what
it was supposed to. It's time to move on to something that might do
the job of orbital delivery better. Or at all.





We don't want to learn how to operate on orbit. It launches, it
shoves out the payload, it lands. It doesn't waste payload hauling
up and down EDO pallets and the like.

The only thing to be learned from shuttle is how *not* to build a
launcher.

Finally: that bit about the ""proven"" shuttle. Are you hoping you can
tell a lie enough times and get someone to believe it?


How much science and technology could have been done is the money spent
on shuttle had been spent differently?

been in Eddington's book, ""Internal Constitution of Stars"", Ch. 13 (1926;

Anton LaVey's interpretation of Satanism has always puzzled me.  I
read his ""Satanic Bible"" a few years ago for a social studies project,
as well as a book by Arthur Lyons called ""The Cult of Devil Worship
in America.""  The latter included a very interesting interview with
the Black Pope in which he did indeed say that Satan was merely an
instrument for one to realize the self.  

When I refer to Satanism, I am referring to the mishmash of rural Satanic
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the Church of Satan.  I
don't consider LaVey's church to be at all ""orthodox,"" nor do I consider
its followers ""satanists.""  LaVey combined the philosophies of Nietzsche,
Crowley, and Reich, slapped in some religious doctrine, added a little
touch of P.T. Barnum, and christened his creation the Church of Satan.
No doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...I
suppose he could have just as easily called it the Church of Free Sex.

At any rate, it worked (for a while).  In its heyday, the Church had a
huge following, including such Hollywood celebrities as Sammy Davis, Jr.
and Jayne Mansfield.  (I have a picture of LaVey with Sammy, by the 
way.)  

I find the idea of a Satanist not believing in Satan about as credible as
a Christian not believing in Christ.  But if you include the Church of
Satan, then I suppose I need to alter my definition.  Webster's Dictionary
and The American Heritage Dictionary will have to do the same.",0

Exactly.  Although this may be a dissapointing answer, there has to be an
interplay of the two.  Personal Ethos and Societal Morality.  A person's
self-generated/learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely
mental/verbal level, and don't usually find expression in society except in an
impure (not in the sense of bad :) ) state.  Sometimes this has to be so.


Also, what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society, in a very
real sense?  To use the obvious example, there is a political society, and a
racial society, and a gender society, and sometimes they do not always agree on
every issue...



Yes.  Perhaps with an infamous ""do what you want so long as it doesn't hurt
others?""  The problem with this is that it is merely saying what you CAN do: it
is not a morality in that it doesn't propound any specifically preferred
behaviours.


I'll add a hearty ""me two"".  However, one could just as well say just because
certain actions are moral does not make them legal: one still doesn't really
get an impression of which one is truly ""right"".

Consider special relativity.  It hasn't be proved, nor has it been
disproved.  No one has a proof one way or the other, but many people
are interested in it!
 
I've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the
existence of God one way or the other.  The two possibilities
are supernaturalism and naturalism.  Of course no set of circumstances can
be inconsistent with supernaturalism, but similarly, no set of circumstances
can be inconsistent with naturalism.  In naturalism, any phenomenon that
could be described as God is considered part of the natural world, to
be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity, for instance).  
For example, if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced, ``I
am God, I exist, and I will prove it by reversing the force of gravity,''
and if then gravity did indeed reverse, a naturalist (probably a scientist)
would say, ``Boy, we sure didn't understand gravity as well as we
thought we did, and that loud voice is something new.  Perhaps we
didn't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''

"        Batse alone isn't always used to determine position.  WHen a
particularly bright burst occurs, There are a couple of other detectors that
catch it going off.  Pioneer 10 or 11 is the one I'm getting at here.  This
puppy is far enough away, that if a bright burst happens nearby, the huge
annulus created by it will hopefully intersect the line or general circle given
by BATSE, and we can get a moderately accurate position. Say oh, 2 or 3
degrees. That is the closest anyone has ever gotten with it.  
        Actually, my advisor, another classmate of mine, and me were talking
the other day about putting just one detector on one of the Pluto satellites. 
THen we realized that the satellite alone is only carrying something like 200
pounds of eq.  Well, a BATSE detector needs lead shielding to protect it, and 1
alone weighs about 200 pounds itself.",2

Brian C., don't you see?  I do not believe that your god is:

	(a) real, or even

	(b) beneficial.

In fact, I believe your religion is imaginary and, carried to
extremes, harmful.  I would like to help you see its shortcomings, and
perhaps someday finally become strong enough to see it for what it is:
an elaborate lie, kept alive by the elite priesthood to keep the
masses properly submissive to their influences.

Please offer me an argument that's more convincing than ""you just
don't believe 'cos you don't want to.""  Everything you've said so far
could apply equally to any religion -- why do you believe yours is the
real one?

(Note that saying ""it's the only one that promises eternal life"" or
something like that isn't an answer to my question, unless you show
that (a) no other religion promises eternal life and (b) it is
unarguably true that eternal life must be a reality.)

For my money the primary danger of anti-cult groups is that they are
every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large
they have no compunctions about printing lies, half-truths and
misleading innuendos as part of their exposes.  A recent book on
cults I picked up by a ""Christian"" author quite simply mixed in
all non-Christian religions (except the Jews) and various New Age
groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.


Given the record of American Christianity, any group that falls
into the category of fundamentalist or born-again is automatically
into the Inquisition business.  It is an unavoidable affliction
of those who have a proprietary license on The Truth (tm).
And let's not forget that Jonestown and the Branch Davidians are
just as much a part of the Christian tradition as the Missouri Synod
Lutherans, and may in fact be the Massadas of true Christian believers.

I am far more concerned about the encroachment of overtly Christian
indoctrination into public schools than I am about yoga classes there.

Ok It is for a game that is 3d and you have listed the characteristics 
that you are looking for. I think you may have left out a few 
important parameters. 
The polygons are all convex. 
They have less than N sides. (you are drawing meshes walls doors etc.)

I believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave / self intersecting polygons. 
This efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that 
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
Complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

The less than N sides specification especially if it is a very small 
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.

Thus for a high speed game application I think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons.  


It may have been that they were very general purpose algorithms.
If you limit yourself to 3 or four sided simple convex polygons
I think you might be suprised how fast a c algorithm with a 
asm block move to fill each scan line might actually be.

"In the New York Times on Sunday May 9th in the week in review
section there was a report of a group called ""Space Marketing""

There was an editorial about this in the Times the following
Tuesday.

Are others as upset about this as I am?  I feel that a global

Space advertisement in LOW Earth Orbit is very short term -- on the
order of a few years before the orbit decays.  (Higher orbits last
longer.)  Advertisers will certainly be aware of the environmental
aspects of their advertising.  Fred's argument is roughly akin to
saying that it's bad to cut down trees, so we shouldn't advertise in
newspapers.  Think that through, Fred.

Picture this: Our space billboard is a LARGE inflatable structure,
filled with ""bio-degradable"" foam instead of gas.  It scoops up space
debris as it orbits, thus CLEANING the space environment and bringing
you The Pause That Refreshes at the same time.  Because of the large
drag coefficient, it will de-orbit -- safely burning up -- within a
year.

Embedded in the foam structure is a small re-entry vehicle, which does
not burn up during entry.  It contains the electronics and propulsion
system (which may be refurbished and re-used) as well as space science
experiments proposed and built by high school students in
advertiser-sponsored science fairs.

Advertisers buy time on the billboard, whose surface is made up of
tiny mirrors controlled by the avionics package.  The avionics can
reconfigure the mirrors to reflect different messages at different
parts of the globe.  Clever programming allows different languages
to every country.

During orbital night, the mirrors turn perpendicular to the surface,
and small lights are revealed.  The lights spell out messages for all
to see.

"Yesterday, I went to the Boeing shareholders meeting.  It was a bit shorter
than I expected.  Last year (when the stock was first down), they made a big
presentation on the 777, and other programs.  This year, it was much more
bare-bones.

In any case, I wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would
hear, and so I got there early, and figured that If I didn't get to the mike,
maybe they would read mine off of a card, and so I wrote it down, and handed it
in.

After the meeting started, Mr. Shrontz said that he would only answer written
questions, in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only
had monitors downstairs.  Naturally, I was crushed.

So, when question and answer time came, I was suprised to find my question
being read and answered.  Admittedly near the end of the ones that he took.
Presumably getting there early, and getting the question in early made all
the difference.

So, on to the substance. The question was 

Is Boeing looking at anything BEYOND the high speed Civil Transport, such
as a commercial space launch system, and if not, how will Boeing compete
with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed
by Mcdonnell Douglass?

Well, he read it without a hitch, and without editing, with impressed me,
then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question, last
part first.

This is to the best of my recollection what he said.

As far as single stage to orbit technology, we think that we have a better
answer in a two stage approach, and we are talking to some of our customers 
about that.  As far as commercialization, that is a long ways off.  The High
speed Civil Transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at
this point.

So, this tells me that Boeing still considers space to be a non-commercial
arena, and for the most part this is true, however it also tells me that 
they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them
to persue work on their own.

Now, I do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing.  Actually,
this is a mis-nomer, as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this
guy is doing, however, he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space
lifter contracts.  He won't tell me what he is doing, but maybe this is where
the TSTO action is taking place at boeing.  At the very minimum, the chairman
of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind, and they are
trying to do something with it.  

Anybody know anything further?
Is this really news?
Does this threaten further work on DC-? ?",2

"
You are in the village. Many happy returns! Be seeing you!",3
"

I disagree.  In the end, the *individual* is responsible for his/her own
irrationality.  The individual's belief in some dogmatic religion is a 
symptom of that irrationality.


Atheists and agnostics, I would imagine, but yes, that was my point.  An
atheist would theoretically be just as ill-equipped to study the philosophy
of religion as a Christian, and yet there is a persistence of atheists
among the ranks of philosophers.  Therefore, the conflict between one's
religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher
must not be as great as you assert.  The fact that most philosophers may
be non-religious was a secondary point.



As opposed to science practiced by theists?  Be careful here.

Science does have a built-in defence against faith and dogma:
skepticism.  Unfortunately, it is not foolproof.  There is that 
wonderful little creature known as the ""theory.""  Many of us believe in
the theory of evolution.  We have no absolute proof that this 
theory is true, so why do we believe it?  Because it ""makes more 
sense than...?""  There is quite a bit of faith involved here.



Well, not ALL current beliefs are deficient, but basically I agree.



Ideally, this is true.  In reality, though, you have to acknowledge
that scientists are human.  Scientists have egos and biases.  Some
scientists assume a particular theory is true, refuse to admit the
flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever, and proceed
to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof 
for the theory.  Remember cold fusion?



Not really.  I agree that we spent far too much money on the Waco
crisis ($7,500,000 I believe), especially considering the outcome.
My point was that mass suicides in the U.S. are rare (Jonestown was
in Guyana, incidentally, although we footed the bill for the clean-up),
and the U.S. has far more important issues to address.  Compare the
number of U.S. citizens who have died in mass suicides with, say, the
number of U.S. soldiers who died during one week of the Vietnam War and

"I didn't want to quote all the stuff that's been said recently, I
just wanted to add a point.

   The whole question of ""a right to a dark sky"" revolves around the
definition of a right.  Moral rights and natural rights are all well and
good, but as far as I can see, a right is whatever you or someone
representing you can enforce.  In most civilizations, the government or
the church (or both) defines what the rights of the citizens are, and
then enforces those rights for them.  Here in the U.S., the constitution
provides a ""Bill of Rights"" from which most if not all legal rights are
considered to derive.  I'm sure that most other countries have
comparable documents.  If you can persuade a court that you have a right
to a dark sky derived in some manner from the Bill of Rights (in the
U.S.), you can prevent (maybe) these billboards from being launched.  To
keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law
and the International Court of Justice (correct name?) in the Hague,

"I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.

When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first
the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln 
where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and
the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.

Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own
colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).

The question is: 
  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get
  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?

All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components
between 0 and 1.

If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?

Then we all live happily ever after. :-)

Seriously, if we all agreed on the circumstances we're in, I suspect we'd all
agree on the best course of action.  Unfortunately, I have no confidence that
such a situation will ever arise. 

Some of us think there's a big God in the sky, some don't.  Some think
they've been chosen by God, others disagree.  Some think they are infallible,
others think otherwise.  Until those disagreements over circumstances can be
ironed out, there's little hope of everyone agreeing.


Yes.  I think that, for example, only a vanishingly small number of people
would hold that there's a frame of reference in which gassing six million
Jews is good.  So that's probably about as close to an objective moral value
as I've encountered in my life so far.


Well, I think your example's poor.  If the bomb's in Iraq, for example, and
was dropped by an American plane, many people would hold that it was a moral
act.


Hmm.  So these moral values have a perceptible physical presence?


Right, and the chain ends right there.  The buck stops with me.  It's not an
infinite regress.


Right.  The key point, however, is that there are vanishingly few of these
moral issues where we can get 99.9% of people to agree on the outcome for all
frames of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)


I can't manage either.  Killing Hitler using a car bomb would have been a
terrorist act, but I have to admit that I couldn't exactly condemn it. 
Although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight...


I think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have
been better than peace.  Better in terms of numbers of innocent people
killed.  Assuming it was successful terrorism, of course.

No, I spent a month just reading, too, mainly because I did not know
much about the way atheists think. I even printed out the FAQs and
discussed it with a friend before I started posting.

Alt.atheism deals with religious issues (more appropriately, lack of
religious beliefs), which are by their very nature very controversial.

	The first and only thing I've ever tried to auto-trace was a piece
of a USCG nautical chart using Adobe Illustrator 3.2.  I wanted to get the
outline of the coast for Western Long Island Sound.  I was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did.  I
suspect what I gave it was a very difficult thing; not only is the coastline
very irregular, but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
(not only lattitude and longitude, but loran grids as well).  The most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line, it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast.  I think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say ""no, dummy, you're going the
wrong way"".

	Steve Reisberg, a friend of mine a few years back(*), did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).
A good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.
This is essentially the same problem that Illustrator tries to solve with
its auto-trace tool.

	In some respects the problem Steve worked on was harder, since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step, but a step on which all future
analysis depended.  However, in other respects, it was an easier problem
since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the
virus particles were supposed to look like, and the analysis could be
restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight,
clean, and well imaged; you don't always have that freedom auto-tracing real
life images.  In any case, it gave me some insight into just how difficult
this problem is to solve in the general case.

	(*) Steve is no longer with us.  He and his wife disappeared while
on vacation in Hawaii a couple of years after they graduated.  Their last
known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area.  While no
bodies were ever found, they are presumed to have been the victim of some
sort of fall or accident in the woods.",1
"

The main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the
primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image
processing software that much faster. When they use the _same_ deconvolution 
software on the images from the fixed Hubble, be ready for some 
incredible results!  There is every reason to believe that the results will 
_exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin.  

Adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software.  It works 
realtime, not after the fact, as is the case with Hubble.  You might be
interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market, in
the form of the AO-2 Adaptive Optics System.  Starting on page 52 of the 
April, 1993 Sky & Telescope is a three page review of this new product.
It lists for $1,290.  The article states: ""The AO-2 Adaptive Optics System 
comes in a handy soft-plastic case that a three-year-old could carry 
around.""  Even though this device is really only good for the brightest
objects, ""it could cope with image movements of up to 0.8 millimeter
in the telescope's focal plane.""  Now just imagine how well this infant 
technology will do in a few years, especially in a dedicated system that 
has hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many man-hours invested in its
development.

"Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe:

The *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the
present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured
in the past. These *facts* exist with or without a theory.

The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate
to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both
coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.

The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation,
relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they
behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain
how they interact... or even why.

A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict
the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this
fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported*
by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation, 
a model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.

In science a theory is something that is supported by the 
evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence.
A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not
yet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis 
is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain
*all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least
some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or

I looked back at this, and asked some questions of various people and
got the following information which I had claimed and you pooh-poohed.
The US has not sold Iraq any arms.  Their navy is entirely made of
F-USSR vessels.  Their airforce (not including stuff captured from Kuwait
which I am not as sure about), doesn't include any US equipment.  Their
missiles are all non-US.  Their tanks are almost all soviet, with about
100 French tanks (older ones). The only US stuff in the Iraqi arsenal
is a few M113s.  Those were not sold to Iraq.  Iraq captured them from
other countries (like Kuwait).  Information is hard to prove.  You are
claiming that the US sold information?  Prove it. 

Now, how did the US build up Iraq again?  I just gave some fairly
conclusive evidence that the US didn't sell arms to Iraq.  Information
is hard to prove, almost certainly if the US did sell information, then that
fact is classified, and you can't prove it.  If you can provide some
useful evidence that the US sold arms or valuable intelligence to Iraq,
I am very interested, but not if you just make claims based on what

"Here's a suggestion for the logical argument FAQ.  I don't think it's covered,
though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one I used:  How about
it, mathew?

INCONSISTENCY AND COUNTEREXAMPLE

This occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes
stand A, which is inconsistent with B.  There are two variations in which B is
either a mutually-agreed-on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same
source.  The second party fallaciously responds by saying ""see, the source
really does say B, it's right here!""; this reply does not refute the allegation
of inconsistency because it does not show that the source _only_ says B.

Example of the first type: ""The Koran says unbelievers should be treated in
these ways.  We can both agree these are immoral.""  ""The Koran clearly says in
this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way.""

Example of the second type: ""There are two Biblical creation stories.""  ""You're
wrong, since the Bible clearly describes the creation as [description].""

Diplomatic :-)

I realize I'm fighting Occam's razor in this argument, so I'll try to
explain why I feel a mind is necessary. 

Firstly, I'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. They're
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out, but not
at working out the method itself.

As a specific example, I like to solve numerical crosswords (not the
simple do-the-sums-and-insert-the-answers type, the hard ones.) To do
these with any efficiency, you need to figure out a variety of tricks.
Now, I know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles, but
in doing so you have to work out the tricks _yourself_, and program
them into the computer. You can, of course, 'obfuscate' the trick, and
write the program so that it is uncovered, but as far as I can see,
the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. Does
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
pre-programmed into our brains? This is somewhat unlikely, given that
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic
material, much of which isn't used.

One way around this is to bring the environment into the equation, but
(again, as far as I can see) this still has an air of 'if you see
object X, then perform action Y,' and we don't seem to get anywhere.
The algorithm has to anticipate what it might see, and what
conclusions to draw from it's experience.

The other problem with algorithms is their instability. Not many
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code, yet
people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are
side-effects, but patients still seem remarkably stable.) Also,
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate -
can an algorithm survive if I randomly corrupt various bits of it's
code?

The next problem is the sticky question of ""What is colour?"" (replace
'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) Presumably, the
materialist viewpoint is that it's the product of some kind of
chemical reaction. The usual products of such a reaction are energy +
different chemicals. Is colour a mixture of these? If this is so, a
computer won't see colour, because the chemistry is different. Does an
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an
equivalent that doesn't? It shouldn't, because the outputs of each
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. So why do
we see colour?



A bit of idle speculation...

If I remember correctly, quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction,
with two processes acting on it. The first process has been called
'Unitary Evolution' (or 'U'), is governed by Schroedinger's equation
and is well known. The second process, called various things such as
'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'R'),
and is more mysterious. It is usually said to occur when a
'measurement' takes place, although nobody seems to know precisely
when that occurs. When it does occur, the effect of R is to abruptly
change the wavefunction.

I envisage R as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something
else,' which I shall imaginitively call 'part X.' It seems reasonable
to assume that _something_ causes R, although that something might be
the wavefunction itself (in which case, part X is simply the
wavefunction. Note, though, that we'd need more than U to explain R.)

Anyway, I'm speculating that minds would be in part X. There seems to
be some link between consciousness and R, in that we never see linear
superpositions of anything, although there are alternative
explainations for this. I've no idea how a brain is supposed to access
part X, but since this is only speculation, that won't matter too
much :-) My main point is that there might be a place for minds in
physics.

I'll go back to my nice padded cell now, if that's OK with you :-)

  Evolution is both fact and theory.  The THEORY of evolution represents the
scientific attempt to explain the FACT of evolution.  The theory of evolution
does not provide facts; it explains facts.  It can be safely assumed that ALL
scientific theories neither provide nor become facts but rather EXPLAIN facts.
I recommend that you do some appropriate reading in general science.  A good
starting point with regard to evolution for the layman would be ""Evolution as
Fact and Theory"" in ""Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes"" [pp 253-262] by Stephen Jay

"Hello
	I have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a
moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. This I appreciated very
much . I would however like to know why it is that ther is simply NO 
information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics
programmer. The subjects are

	1) How do you access the extra video memory on a video board. I
know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to
dothis. I have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books
and info I have read I am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. There is a
way to do this in standard VGA cause I have seen vidoe paging (written in
assembly, which I don't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. To get
any speed at all you have to do this. How do I do it?

	2) The vesa standard. What gives here. I have read most of what
the net has to offer on VESA and as far as coding for VESA goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best. Where do I get public domain info that will
tell me in ""mostly plain"" english how the vesa calls work.

	My biggest gripe is about number 1. I have bought graphics books,
I have asked graphics professors, I have hunted the net through both
gopher, and archie, I ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information. Graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information, but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios. What are all the calls folks, I
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. Where
are you, and why haven't you written a book yet?

Maddi,

I see that you still can't grasp the obvious, is it because your are devious
by nature, or can you only find fault with an argument by
misrepresenting it?

I plainly said that I was stating the Christian position as I
understand it, I did not say whether I agree with it since my point
was that the only flaws in that position are those atheists invent.
I have never claimed to be an expert on anything and especially
Christianity, but I have made it an object of pretty intense study
over the years, so I feel qualified to discuss what its general
propositions are.

What offends you is that I have exposed the distortions and
misrepresentations of Christianity you contrive and then rail against,
(which seems more like the classical strawman dodge than what I said)

avoid the larger issues by picking away at the insignificant stuff, why not

[Deleted for space; basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that

In reverse order:

1) Try clicking in the auto-apply box to switch it off. Then make your mods. Then
click on apply. There is no problem as stated; it has already been solved if you
look carefully.

2) Yes XV is an 8 bit program. This is not a bug. You can edit individual pallette
entries or do global colour changes; crop, scale etc. Clearly the program must
save out the *altered* image else all your work would be thrown away. So yes it
saves out 8 bit images - of course!

XV can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. This is a handy
facility, not a bug.

How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How would you group
'related' colours to edit them together? Only global changes could be done
unless the software were very different and much more complicated.

If you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image, you need much more powerfull
software - which is readily available commercially.

And lastly, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It can be applied to any image of
arbitrary bit depth. Again, this is not a bug. It is a way of saving disk space
;-)

Ahh, perhaps that's why we've (astronomers) have just built *2* 10-meter
ground-based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones.
Seriously, though, you're never going to get a 10-meter scope into orbit
as cheaply as you can build one on the ground, and with adaptive optics
and a good site, the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit
anyway.  Also, scopes in low orbit (like Hubble) can only observe things
continuously for ~45 minutes at a time, which can be a serious
limitation.

Wrong about what?   I think they are correct in thinking that a 
well-placed bomb or six would get headlines, but I think they are 
wrong if they think that you can set off bombs and still be a 
Buddhist.

Maybe what we are seeing here is that Chinese cultural genocide
against the Tibetans has worked well enough that some Tibetans 
are now no longer Buddhist and are instead willing to behave like
the Chinese occupiers.   Every action is its own reward.


On the other hand, people who are aware of the occupation are mostly
full of admiration for the peaceful way that Tibetans have put up
with it.   And what does it cost us to admire them?   Zip.


Yes they are, and whether this serves them well or not depends on 
whether they want Buddhist principles or political independence.
And without political independence can they preserve their cultural
and religious traditions?


The Chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists, just as
the Hitler regime used to refer to European resistance movements
as terrorists.


Better off in what way?   As proponents of pacifism or as 
proponents of political autonomy?

And better off in what time-scale?   The Soviet Empire practised
cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities,
some of which resisted violently, and some of which did not, but
in the end it was the Soviet Empire that collapsed and at least
some of the minorities survived.

Now some of the minorities are fighting one another.    Is that

I already responded to this on one dimension, but afterthoughts cause
me to make another, independent reply.  The problem with a ""moment of
silence"" is that it is NOT an even-handed way of ""allowing"" for religion
amongst students in the public schools.  As I noted before, Muslims need
more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are
required by Muhammad to do.  And (at least Orthodox) Jewish prayer also
has requirements that are not addressed by this.

There is, in fact, a highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in
this ""moment of silence"" shit.  And that is especially bizarre in that
Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff -- a Christain may pray totally
incognito AT ANY TIME (to some extent, this is true of Muslims and Jews
as well -- what I intend in my first paragraph is that there *are* some
characteristic forms of prayer in *these* religions which DO need special
times and/or behavior, which cannot be undertaken without an observer 
being able taking note of it.)

A Christian may pray, at ANY time -- silently and without any trace of
his activity being evident to others.  That may or may not be true of the
other religious traditions amongst us: certainly, these tend to have SOME
forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American/Protestant
""mainstream"" religion.

All that a ""moment of silence"" does is to allow THAT ONE tradition which
doesn't NEED it, to have a ""special"" place set aside in the public schools.
There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms, or rugs,
or phylacteries, or anything else at all visible to the outside world.  A
Christian student MAY (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during
the day, without anyone else knowing it.  [That may also be true of non-
Christians -- I am not claimng otherwise].  In the ""moment of silence"" it
would STILL be difficult for the Jews to gather and daven, for the Muslims
to do their ablutions and find qiblah to Mecca and engage in the prescribed
forms.  But *of course* Christians can do *their* thing -- and therefore,
the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.

Luckily, there *is* a strong Jewish presence in this country (and I, as
a Christian, revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools),
and a growing Muslim presence as well.  I can only hope that the political
forces consequent on this will PREVENT the imposition of Christian forms
on non-Christians.

As far as I can see (as a Christian) there is NOTHING in this ""moment of
silence"" campaign but an attempt to use PUBLIC social pressure to FORCE
children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards Christianity.  And
as a Christian, I *must* protest such coercion.  For what it's worth, I
suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians --
it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in ""making""
their children prayerful, so that they want the public schools to teach
what THEY cannot manage to teach, despite having all the opportunity in
the world to do so.

If you have taught your children to pray, they do NOT need a moment of
silence in school.  If you have NOT managed to teach them, the moment
will only embarrass you.  Give it up.",3

      MVS/XA                :  /pub/gopher/mvs/

     Many other clients and servers have been developed by others, the
     following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.  

      A Microsoft Windows Winsock client ""The Gopher Book""
        sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/micro/pc-stuff/ms-windows/winsock/goph_tbk.zip

      A Macintosh Application, ""MacGopher"".
        ftp.cc.utah.edu:/pub/gopher/Macintosh *

      Another Macintosh application, ""GopherApp"".
        ftp.bio.indiana.edu:/util/gopher/gopherapp *

      A port of the UNIX curses client for DOS with PC/TCP
        oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu:/public/dos/misc/dosgopher.exe

      A port of the UNIX curses client for PC-NFS
     	 bcm.tmc.edu:/nfs/gopher.exe

      A beta version of the PC Gopher client for Novell's LAN Workplace
      for DOS
         lennon.itn.med.umich.edu:/dos/gopher

      A VMS DECwindows client for use with Wollongong or UCX
         job.acs.ohio-state.edu:XGOPHER_CLIENT.SHARE


     * Note: these Macintosh clients require MacTCP.

     Most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
     itself.  Put the following on a gopher server:

       Type=1
       Host=boombox.micro.umn.edu
       Port=70
       Path=
       Name=Gopher Software Distribution.

 
     Or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu, port 70 and
     look in the gopher directory.


     There are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
     The University of Minnesota operates one on the machine
     ""consultant.micro.umn.edu"" (134.84.132.4) See Q3 for more
     information about this.  It is recommended that you run the client
     software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites.  A
     client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse,
     scroll bars, etc.)  A local client is also faster.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3:  Where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
     in order to get a taste of gopher) for Gopher?

A3:  Here is a short list, use the site closest to you to minimize
     network lag.

     Telnet Public Logins:

     Hostname                  IP#              Login   Area
     ------------------------- ---------------  ------  -------------
     consultant.micro.umn.edu  134.84.132.4	gopher  North America
     gopher.uiuc.edu           128.174.33.160   gopher  North America
     panda.uiowa.edu           128.255.40.201	panda   North America
     gopher.sunet.se           192.36.125.2     gopher  Europe
     info.anu.edu.au           150.203.84.20    info    Australia
     gopher.chalmers.se        129.16.221.40    gopher  Sweden
     tolten.puc.cl             146.155.1.16     gopher  South America
     ecnet.ec		           157.100.45.2     gopher  Ecuador
     gan.ncc.go.jp             160.190.10.1     gopher  Japan


     It is recommended that you run the client software instead of
     logging into the public login sites.  A client uses the
     custom features of the local machine (mouse, scroll bars, etc.)
     and gives faster response.  Furthermore many of the basic features
     of clients - saving a file to your hard drive, printing a file
     to a local printer, viewing images, retrieving files from ftp
     sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.

Q4:  Who Develops Gopher Software?

A4:  Gopher was originally developed in April 1991 by the University
     of Minnesota Microcomputer, Workstation, Networks Center to help
     our campus find answers to their computer questions.  

     It has since grown into a full-fledged World Wide Information
     System used by a large number of sites in the world.

     Many people have contributed to the project, too numerous to
     count. 

     The people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
     via e-mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu, or via paper mail:
   
      Internet Gopher Developers
      100 Union St. SE #190
      Minneapolis, MN 55455  USA

     Or via FAX at:
 
      +1 (612) 625-6817

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Q5: What is the relationship between Gopher and (WAIS, WWW, ftp)?

A5: Gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
     As shipped the Unix gopher server has the capability to: 
     
       - Search local WAIS indices.
       - Query remote WAIS servers and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
         clients.
       - Be queried by WWW (World Wide Web) clients (either using
         built in gopher querying or using native http querying.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: Are papers or articles describing Gopher available?

A6: Gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in :

Q7: What is veronica?

A7: veronica:  Very Easy Rodent-Oriented Net-wide Index to 
     Computerized Archives.

     veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher-server menu titles
     in the entire gopher web.  As archie is to ftp archives, veronica 
     is to gopherspace.  A veronica search produces a menu of gopher
     items, each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
     Because veronica is accessed through a gopher client, it is easy
     to use, and gives access to all types of data supported by the
     gopher protocol.

     To try veronica, select it from the ""Other Gophers"" menu on 
     Minnesota's gopher server, or point your gopher at:

     Name=veronica (search menu items in most of GopherSpace) 
     Type=1 
     Port=70 
     Path=1/veronica 
     Host=futique.scs.unr.edu

I think this should be illuminating to all. Let me make a first
suggestion. When Arabic words, especially technical ones, become of use 
let us define them for those, especially atheists, to whom they may not be
terribly familiar. Please also note that though I did initially refer
to Khomeini as a heretic for what I understood to be a claim -- rejected 
by you since -- of personal infallibility, I withdraw this as a basis
for such a statement. I conditionally retain this reference in regard
to Khomeini's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the 
so-called ""Twelve Imams,"" which is in clear conflict with the Qur'an 
in that it places the Twelve Imams in a category of behavior and example
higher than that of the Muhammad, in that the Qur'an shows that the
Prophet was clearly fallible, as well as (it appears, given your
abstruse theological statment regarding the ""natures""  of the Twelve
Imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the 
remainder of humanity, with the possible exception of Muhammad, 
something which verges on the sin of association.

As I understand, that number is deceptive.  The reason is that the money
cost was in non-oil sales for the most part.  Iraq still is not allowed
to sell oil, or do many of the things under the initial sanctions, but
is still surviving.


Of the ~93% (I have heard figures closer to 80%, but I won't quibble your
figures), most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by
enemy troops.  A B-52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie, and we used them
around the clock.  Not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb
munitions.  

2.  The Patriot uses a proximity fuse.  The adjusted figures for number
of Patriot kills of SS-1 derivitives is ~60-70%.  That figure came
not from some fluke in the Pentagon, but a someone working with such
stuff in another part of DoD.

3.  The statement precision bombing was the norm, is true around areas
where civilians were close to the target.  We dropped by tonnage very
little bombs in populated regions, explaining the figures.  


This figure, is far below all the other figures I have seen.  If it
is indeed accurate, then how do you explain the discrepancy between
that figure, and other figures from international organizations?
Most figures I have seen place the hit ratio close to 70%, which is 
still far higher than your 35%.  Or does your figure say a bomb
missed if the plane took off with it, and the bomb never hit the target,
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped?  Such methods
are used all the time to lie with statistics.


I have _never_ seen any source that was claiming such a figure.  Please
post the source so its reliability can be judged.

"Once again, this posting has been delayed for about a week by falling
between some software cracks...


[Here follows an introduction to the controversial incident, and an
 apologetic explanation purporting to show why it couldn't actually
 have happened.  The historicity of the episode doesn't matter to what
 follows]

I don't know whether I'm quoting Gregg or Zakaria below.  Anyway, back
to current affairs,


Among others; this incident is not something Rushdie or Watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere, it is a well known story, a myth if you
will, known (according to Umar Khan) to ""Every Muslim school boy and
girl"", and so presumably to Rushdie, and to Gibreel Farishta.


Yes, this is what writing fiction is all about.  Rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith, and chose this myth to present it, by placing
the actor ""Gibreel"" in the role of the angel whose name he took.
Rushdie was not writing a history or theology book, and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened.  It's somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between Jesus and the reformed
prostitute Mary Magdalene (another myth).  Or those referring to the
Arthurian mythos, or the Grail legend, or the Wandering Jew, or dozens
of others.  If you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer,
consider Salman Rushdie's children's book ""Haroun and the Sea of
Stories"" for an idea of the way a storyteller -- a specific
storyteller -- works with existing story lines.


No.  Muhammad's [Mahound's] integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story, and there's no reason to think this was Rushdie's
intent: Gibreel, as the archangel, produces the verses (divine and
satanic), though he doesn't know their provenance.  It is not implied
(in a straight reading) that Muhammad influences them:

    "" *Not my voice* I'd never know such words I'm no classy speaker
    never was never will be but this isn't my voice it's a Voice.
      Mahound's eyes open wide, he's seeing some kind of vision,
    staring at it, oh, that's right, Gibreel remembers, me.  He's
    seeing me.  My lips moving, being moved by.  What, whom?  Don't
    know, can't say.  Nevertheless, here they are, coming out of my
    mouth, up my throat, past my teeth: the Words.
      Being God's postman is no fun, yaar.
      Butbutbut: God isn't in this picture.
      God knows whose postman I've been.""

It's ambiguous: is Mahound somehow manipulating Gibreel?  Is it Satan?
Or something else?  The answer is not given.

To be sure, the question is raised.  This novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion, among other things.  Addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation,
but this novel proposes no answers, at least not directly.  The very
existence of a newsgroup named ""alt.atheism"" raises the same
questions, more forcefully, and does propose some answers, which is
the real relevance.  If Rushdie's mild fictional exploration is ""filth
and lies"", and he ""asked for what he got"", are we next on the fatwa
list?  (That's a rhetorical question, of course.)

"Forwarded from the Mars Observer Project

                       MARS OBSERVER STATUS REPORT
                             April 30, 1993
                              11:30 AM PDT

DSS-65 (Madrid 34 meter antenna) did not acquire the expected Mars Observer
Spacecraft signal at the scheduled beginning of track yesterday morning (4/29)
at approximately 6:00 AM.  Indications were that the spacecraft had entered a
Fault Protection mode sometime between that time and receipt of normal
telemetry at the end of the previous station pass (DSS-15 - Goldstone 34
meter antenna) at approximately 8:00 PM the evening before.  Entry into
Contingency Mode was verified when signal was reacquired and telemetry
indicated that the spacecraft was sun coning.  After subsystem engineers
reported all systems performing nominally, fault protection telemetry modes
were reconfigured and memory readouts of command system Audit Queue and
AACS (Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem) Starex performed.  These
readouts verified that Contingency Mode entry occurred shortly after 1:30 AM
yesterday, 4/29/93.  Preliminary indications are that a Sun Ephemeris Check
failure triggered fault protection.  However, the Flight Team will be
determining the precise cause over the next few days.

As of last evening, the spacecraft had been commanded back to Inertial
Reference and was stable in that mode.  The Flight Team is planning to
command the spacecraft back to Array Normal Spin state today.",2

Yes, that's exactly what I felt.  My heart just felt that what I was
being taught was *wrong* -- a basically good message, but framed in
errors.  I could not with a clear conscience accept that women were
somehow not equal to men, that homosexuals are ""guilty"" of their
lifestyle, that pride in one's work is a bad thing, that Jesus died
for me -- I don't want ANYBODY to die for me, especially as an
impersonal act where the person can't possibly even *know* me well
enough to really know if I'm worth dying for or not.

I was never able to accept the bit about Jesus's death being a good
thing.  If that means that I'm just not comprehending a basic message
of Christianity, then so be it.  Maybe I'm just not compatible with
Christianity.  I just refuse to follow rules blindly, and since I
can't even convince myself that your god even EXISTS in the way you
describe it, I've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.

don't believe in your god.  I will not steal, and I will not murder --
not because I fear divine repudiation, but because these just *aren't*
in my character.  You may think there's nothing keeping me from just
running around on a murdering spree, stealing things when I'm able,
insulting people for the heck of it, because I'm not answerable to
anyone; but you'd be wrong.  I'm answerable to myself.  A life like
that would be a cheap life; I happen to want to earn respect in myself.


My initial break with Christianity came after a lot of soul-searching
and a lot of wondering why I could no longer feel the 'presence' of
God with me.  I finally decided that I had once ""felt"" this presence
just as I had ""felt"" my mighty teddy bear beside me when I was a
little tyke, protecting me from the monsters under the bed -- that I
had believed in God just as I had believed in the teddy bear, as
something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.

Since then, I've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your
supernatural trinity does exist.  But there are a few times when, in
my darkened room by my bed, I have set aside everything I believe for
a moment and called out to whatever's out there, because I want to
know the truth even if it means abandoning everything I know.  And I
have not yet received an answer.


Nope.  It may well be unknowable.  Scientists have suggested that the
universe may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three-dimensional
universe may be mapped onto a four-dimensional supersphere in the same
way you can map a two-dimensional plane onto a three-dimensional
sphere; see _Sphereland_, the sequel to _Flatland_, for more thoughts
on this).  Our entire universe might just be an electron in a four-
dimensional universe, which in turn may only be an insignificant speck
in a universe above that, and so on and so forth until the variables
become too much for us to even speculate on.

That is, there's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to
be, so there's no reason at all to believe that your God exists nor
had anything to do with it.


Christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy
book, and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe: guilt
trips, insinuations that I'm without morals, arguments from disbelief
(""how can you possibly believe that God *doesn't* exist?""), and so
forth.  All I'm asking is for you to convince me.  I want to be convinced,
but it's not going to be easy.


Having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both
the inside and the outside, I view it as harmful in many ways.  It
preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives, and once it's
got these people, it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly
intolerant) of others who do not share these views.  Maybe you'll say
that your religion doesn't teach that -- but I've got to judge
Christianity from the Christians I know.

I feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one's
self, and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason
than that.

So I hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some
people think.  I want Christians to realize that there are perfectly
valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity
whatsoever, and I want people who are considering Christianity to
realize that Christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy,
fulfilled life.

I have known some very nice Christians who have done some very nice
things.  I think what sets these people apart from the general masses
is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong, and
they know the weaknesses of their religion, yet they still decide to
believe, but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think
any less of people who don't agree with them.


Precisely my point.  You've still not given me a reason to be a
Christian instead of a Buddhist or a Moslem...


... just as the Moslems aren't religious, and the Buddhists aren't
religious.  Who *is* religious, then?

We here at IBM have the same problem with our workstations.  I was also
shocked when I first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer).  This seems huge, but is only
1/256 of the dynamic range.  In those terms it doesn't seem so bad.  What
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear, due
mainly to roundoff, I believe.  So the polygon is not planar in z, but is
more like a Ruffles potato chip.  Ditto with lines.  When you start/end at
different x/y values, the ""ridges"" are out of phase, resulting in the
stitch effect.  You have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon
right on top of another, but with different vertices.  You will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap.
  Example:
  Try Polygon 1: (100,100,100) (100,200,100) (200,200,100) (200,100,100)
      Polygon 2: (125,125,100) (125,175,100) (175,175,100) (175,125,100)

Your implementation is correct.  In fact, we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons - such as NURBS surfaces
with isoparametric lines.  Without the trick, the lines appear stitched, as
you say.  When the application draws lines/polygons independently, the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting, so the
application must do it.  This is what you have discovered and are doing.
Bravo!

Dear me. This is taken _so_ out of context that it's hard to know where
to start... The quote starts with material from p 78, and ends with material
from page 81!

On page 78, there's the bit that says (the parts left out in John King's
""quote"" are marked by <>):
""<...> the doubt that has infiltrated the previous, smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology<'s last twenty years> has inflamed passions <and
provoked some very interesting thought and research>.""

Eldridge goes on immediately following the butchered quote:
""In short, evolutionary biology has entered a phase of creativity that is
the hallmark of good, active science.""

The material that is on page 81 that is ""quoted"" by John King has been
butchered even more severely:

""<I mention this only to illustrate the> **There is**[these words not
in the original text-prl] lack of agreement even within warring camps
<: things are really in uproar these days, and each of the ""basic"" ways
of looking at evolutionary biology has its minor variants.> Sometimes
it seems as if there are as many variations on each evolutionary theme
as there are individual biologists.""

Eldridge goes on:
""But that's the way it should be; this is how science is supposed to operate.""


And just a few sentences down:

""When they [creationists] misrepresent the exuberant, creative doubt and
controversy permeating evolutionary biology these days, they are actively
promoting scientific illiteracy.""

And that, John E. King, is precisely what you have done with Eldridge's
article. Are you personally responsible for the butchery of the text or
have you pulled it out of some creationist propaganda? You owe the people
reading t.o an apology for posting such misrepresentation.

Well, GIF stands for Graphics Interchange Format and was put forth by
Compuserve back in 1987(?) or so.  It was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system.  GIF is limited to 8 bit color but has
a built in compression scheme (LZW?).

IFF is not really a graphics format, but rather a standard way to package
images, sounds, animations, text, or whatever into one file.  IFF was
created by Electronic Arts, I do believe (I could be wrong), for the Amiga.
It was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the Amiga.
The most common image format for the IFF package is an ILBM (InterLeaved
BitMap?) but many others exist.  This format supports 24 bit color images.

	Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord
	have been encouraged to speak the word of God more
	courageously and fearlessly.

	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and 
	rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so
	in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. 
	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not

	me while I am chains. But what does it matter? 

	The important thing is that in every way, whether from
	false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because
	of this I rejoice.
	
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are
human and imperfect. Whatever we ""preach,"" no matter how eloquent, or
how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master's
voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the

      _The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
      no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
      to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
      ""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
      by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
      least it was a good try...

   So you have a plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances?

I don't have any plausible models for GRBs at any distances ;-)

   Recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star
   hypothesis, which had a lot of problems, anyhow.  We have to look for
   implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of
   models.

Hmm, the ""superbowl"" burst has been claimed in press releases
to cast doubt on the merging NS hypothesis, from what I've read
(and I haven't seen the papers, only the press) I'd say it is
consistent with some of the merging NS models

   A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came
   through the astrophysics abstract service.  To get a copy of this

   Here is the abstract of that paper.

 ...
      indicator to these events all possible sources which are
      isotropically distributed should remain under consideration. This is
      why the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list,
      although there is no known mechanism for generating \GRBs
      from cometary nuclei. Unlikely as it may seem, the possibility that \GRBs
      originate in the solar cometary cloud
      cannot be excluded until it is disproved.

This does not propose a _mechanism_ for GRBs in the Oort (and, no,
anti-matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far
as I understand annihilation spectra...). Big difference.
That's ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution
to the Oort distribution when the Oort distribution is not well
known - in particular comet aphelia (which are not well known)
are not a good measure of the Oort cloud distribution...

"[ . . .]

I am a relativist who would like to answer your question, but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable.  The concepts of ""right""
and ""wrong"" (or ""correct/incorrect"" or ""true/false"") belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions.  It makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong, although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).

Let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics:  perception and motivation, respectively.
One can certainly ask if a percept is ""right"" (correct, true,
veridical) or ""wrong"" (incorrect, false, illusory).  But it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false.  On the other hand, it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil, but one can
certainly ask that question about motives.

Therefore, your suggested answers (a)-(c) simply can't be considered:
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

Now the problem with (d) is that it is double-barrelled:  I agree with
the first part (that the ""rightness"" of a moral position is a
meaningless question), for the reasons stated above.  But that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that
one cannot feel peace is better than war.  I certainly can make
value judgments (bad, better, best) without asserting the ""correctness""
of the position.

Sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)-(d).  My short (e) answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue,
neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect).  They simply hold
different moral values (feelings).",0

Assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'

more common -in the US- Fahrenheit), you are still laboring under at
least 2 misconceptions:

1.  You seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 C.
    Actually, the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are
    iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 C.  Even if the gun
    were found in area which achieved the 1000 C temperature, the steel
    parts of the gun would not be deformed, and it would still be
    trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.

2.  A fire is not an isothermal process.  There are 'hot' spots and
    'cold' spots, though 'cold' is purely a relative term.   So the
    weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot, as you seem to

You can do a whole hell of a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with
the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network.
Ignore the directional information from BATSE; just look at the time
of arrival.  With three detectors properly arranged, one can often
get positions down to ~arc minutes.

BTW, about Oort cloud sources: shouldn't this be testable in the
fairly near future?  Some of the GRBs have very short rise times (< 1
ms).  We could detect the curvature of the burst wavefront out to a
distance of on the order of b^2/(t c) where b is the detector spacing
and t the time resolution.  For t = 1 ms and b = 2 AU, this is on the
order of 16 light years.  I understand statistics will reduce this

: but the body does adjust.  The feeling is not too different from that
: of sky diving.

I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll
tell you about my first flight.

At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine
straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab
onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)
to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my
involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could
feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while
you have a cold).

At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,
since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment
going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of
gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay
attention to physiology at that time.

After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one
of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion
sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly
-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,
concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to
parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I
had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically
useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in
the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just
this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.
(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous

I'm a volunteer in JSC's Space Biomedical Laboratory where they do,
among other things, some of the tests Ron mentions.  I was in one
called the Pre-flight Adaptation Trainer, which consisted of a chair on
a several-degree-of-freedom motion base with moving geometric visual
aids.  The goal was to measure the victim's^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H subject's
responses and subjective physiological descriptions and see if repeated
exposure to this environment could reduce future motion sickness
symptoms.

One performance reason comes to mind: if you jettison the SSME's, you
don't have to drag them with you when you perform your circularization
burn(s).  On-orbit, SSME's are just dead weight, since we don't have an
SSME H2/O2 pressurization mechanism which works in zero-G.  This means
that you can't use them for re-boost or anything else.  Dead weight has
a couple of advantages, but more disadvantages.

Throw-away SSME's might let us use some of the old SSME's which are not-
quite-man-ratable.  But I doubt we'd do that; the cost of a launch
failure is too high.

The idea of an apostacy did not originate with Lucy Smith or Joseph
Smith or the Mormons.  The idea of a restoration was quite common
in the early 19th century USA.  Alexander Campbell, founder of the
group that now survives with the name ""Disciples of Christ"" preached
that the primitive church had been lost and was attempting to restore
it (although not be revelations).  Many Cambellites subsequently became
Mormons, including co-founder Sidney Rigdon.  Actually, you can find
such sentiments in many of the early protestants of the reformation,
such as Martin Luther.

It is also well known that the comments in Josephus relating to Jesus were

on the issue of Jesus...  You know not of what you speak.  Here are a few
contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.


Acts 1:18: ""Now this man (Judas) purchased a field with the reward of 
iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his

Before the cock crow - Matthew 26:34

Before the cock crow twice - Mark 14:30


MAR 14:72  And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind  the 
word  that  Jesus  said unto him, Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny
me thrice. And when he thought thereon, he wept.

MAT 26:74  Then began he to curse and to swear,  saying,  I  know not the man.
And immediately the cock crew.
MAT 26:75  And Peter remembered the word  of  Jesus,  which  said unto him,
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept
bitterly.

LUK 22:60  And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest.  And immediately,
while he yet spake, the cock crew.
LUK 22:61  And the Lord turned, and looked upon Peter. And  Peter remembered
the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou
shalt deny me thrice.

JOH 13:38  Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake? 
Verily,
 verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, still thou hast denied me
thrice.

JOH 18:27  Peter then denied  again:  and  immediately  the  cock crew.


(This is interesting because Matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made! 
Not the only time he does this either...)

saying,  And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was

scarlet - Matthew 27:28

purple John 19:2


Mark says the third hour, or 9 a.m., but John says the sixth hour (noon) was
when the sentence was passed.


Matthew  --  This is Jesus the king of the Jews
Mark	 --  The King of the Jews
Luke	 --  This is the king of the Jews
John	 --  Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews


vinegar - Matthew 27:34

wine with myrrh - Mark 15:23


Matthew said many stood far off, including Mary Magdaline, Mary the mother of
James, and the mother of Zebedee's children.  Mark and Luke speak of many far
off, and Mark includes Mary Magdeline and Mary the mother of James the less.
John says that Jesus's mother stood at the cross, along with her sister and
Mary Magdalene.


Matt.27:46,50: ""And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, 
saying, ""Eli, eli, lama sabachthani?"" that is to say, ""My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?""  ...Jesus, when he cried again with a loud voice,
yielded u the ghost.""

Luke23:46: ""And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, ""Father, unto
 thy hands I commend my spirit:"" and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.""

John19:30: ""When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is 
finished:"" and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.""


Matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent, that there was an
earthquake, and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour, that graves
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into Jeruselem, appearing to
many (beating Jesus to the resurection). Mark and Luke speak of darkness and
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints. 
John is the only one who mentions Jesus's side being peirced.


Matthew says the Jews asked Pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being
stolen by the disciples, and for the tomb to be sealed. All of this was
supposedly done, but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.

Depends where you look; Matthew 12:40 gives Jesus prophesying that he will
spend ""three days and three nights in the heart of the earth"", and Mark 10:34
has ""after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again"". As far as I can
see from a quick look, the prophecies have ""after three days"", but the
post-resurrection narratives have ""on the third day"".


Matthew says Sunday at dawn, Mark says the sun was rising, and John says it
was dark.


MAT 28:1  In the end of the sabbath, as it began to  dawn  toward the first
day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.

MAR 16:1  And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the  mother 
of  James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and
anoint him.

JOH 20:1  The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene  early, when  it 
was  yet  dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre.


MAT 28:2  And, behold, there was  a  great  earthquake:  for  the angel of the
Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door,
and sat upon it.
MAT 28:3  His countenance was like  lightning,  and  his  raiment white as
snow: MAT 28:4  And for fear of him the keepers did shake,  and  became as
dead men. MAT 28:5  And the angel answered and said unto  the  women,  Fear
not ye: for I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.

MAR 16:5  And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a  young  man sitting  on 
the right side, clothed in a long white garment; and they were affrighted.

LUK 24:4  And it came  to  pass,  as  they  were  much  perplexed thereabout,
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:

JOH 20:12  And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at  the head,  and 
the  other  at  the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.


Matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story, but no other gospel makes
this claim.


Matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two Marys and that Jesus also told
them, to tell the disciples to meet him in Galilee.  The disciples then went
to a mountain previously agreed opon, and met Jesus there.  This was his only
appearance, except to the women at the tomb.  Matthew only devotes five verses
to the visit with the disciples.

Mark says that Jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country, and that
they told the rest of the disciples, who refused to believe.  Later he
appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.

Luke says two followers went, the same day that Jesus rose from the dead, to
Emmaus, a village eight miles from Jeruselem, and there Jesus jioned them but
was unrecognised.  While they ate a meal together that evening, they finally
recognised Jesus, whereopon he dissapeared.  Returning at once to Jeruselem,
they told the
disciples of their experience, and suddenly Jesus appeared among them,
frightening them, as they thought he was a spirit.  Jesus then ate some fish
and honey and then preached to them.

John says Jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose, in
Jeruselem, where they were hiding.  He breathed the Holy Ghost opon them, but
Thomas was not present and refused to believe. Eight days later Jesus joined
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced Thomas.	Once
more Jesus made an
appearance to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias but again was not
recognised.
 After telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat, Jesus
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them.  They all eat
together and converse.

The book of acts further adds to the confusion.  It says that Jesus showed
himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus
contradicting Matthew, Mark, Luke AND John) and spoke to them of things
pertaining to the kingdom of God: ""And when he had spoken these things, while
they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. 
And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, two men stood
by them in white apparel: Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye
gazing into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken from you into heaven,
shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven"" Acts 1:3-11

Paul outdoes every other ""authority"" by saying that Jesus was seen by 500
persons between the time of the resurection and the
assension, although he does not say where.	He also claims that he himself ""as
one born out of due time"" also saw Jesus. 1 Cor 15:6-8.


Matthew says nothing about it.	Mark casually says that Jesus was recieved into
heaven after he was finished talking with the
disciples in Jeruselem.  Luke says Jesus led the desciples to Bethany and that
while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. 
John says nothing about it.  Acts
contradicts all of the above.  (See previous section)


MAT 24:34  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all
these things be fulfilled.

MAR 13:30  Verily I say unto you, that this generation shall  not pass, till
all these things be done.

LUK 21:32  Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not  pass away, till
all be fulfilled.

1 thessalonians 4:15-18

1 Corinthians 15:5 (12)
Matthew 27:3-5 (minus one from 12)
Acts 1:9-26 (Mathias not elected until after resurrection)
MAT 28:16  Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a mountain
where Jesus had appointed them.

	""And Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven."" (2 Kings 2:11)

	""No man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven, 	...
the Son of Man."" (John 3:13)

As you can see, there are a number of contradictions in the account of the
trial, crucifiction and resurection of Jesus.  If these are good witnesses,
you would think that they could get SOME of these important details right! 
(In fact, I cannot find very many points on where they AGREE.  You would think
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly
observing!) Because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error,
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.
(Due to the nature of the story, I doubt if it should be taken as ANY sort of
truth.)",0

I've been following this train of talk, and the question of dismissing atoms as  
being in some sense ""not real"" leaves me uneasy.

It seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects, and therefore the  
underlying thing is not necessarily real.  The tree outside my window is in  
this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it, not the tree  
itself.  The observation is indirect, but no more so than observations I have  
made of atoms.

Also, what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done  
with individual atoms.  I am thinking in particular of atom trapping  
experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum Zeno  
effect, where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.

Some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying  
either.  One has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid  
technical background in the field.  What I read seemed a little confused a  
quite a red herring.

No.  Zeno's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite
series of decreasing terms can sum to a finite result.


Well, suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was
sent towards a black hole.  As it got closer to the event horizon, the
red shift would keep increasing.  The period would get longer and longer,
but it would never stop.  An observer would not observe the probe actually
reaching the event horizon.  The detected energy from the probe would keep
decreasing, but it wouldn't vanish.  Exp(-t) never quite reaches zero.

I guess the above probably doesn't make things any more clear, but hopefully
you will get the general idea maybe.",3

No, if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field, it produces a voltage.
The two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or
move the conductor.  The slow shifting of the Earth's magnetic field isn't
really significant, especially when you consider how weak the Earth's magnetic
field is to begin with.


Well, it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel
the Earth's magnetic field (as a magnet can repel another magnet).  Of course,
this force only works in one direction, and the magnetic field generated has
to be unimaginably powerful.  Magnetic repulsion drops off as 1/r^3, and the
earth's magnetic field on the surface is already very weak.  It would require
some sort of unknown superconductor, and special nonmagnetic construction.
And seriously hardenned electronics (optical computers, perhaps).  And the
physiological danger would be significant (due to the iron content in our
blood, among other things).  In other words, forget it.


I missed out on the ""dragless satellite"" thread, but it sounds totally bogus,
from this little bit.",2
"
Well, it's not that simple -- you're in Earth's magnetic field, and you
don't generate electricity -- but it can be done.


The way you power things is with electricity, so the answer to the first
question is definitely yes.  (If you meant to say ""propel"" rather than
""power"", the answer is ""sort of"".)  Yes, you can use interaction with the
Earth's magnetic field to get electrical power, and there are potential
applications for this.

However, bear in mind that there is no free lunch.  The energy isn't
coming from nowhere.  What such systems do is convert some of the energy
of your orbital velocity into electrical energy.  There are cases where
this is a useful tradeoff.  Using power obtained in this way for propulsion
is useful only in special situations, however.

What you *can* do is get your power by some other means, e.g. solar arrays,
and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse, pumping energy
*into* the orbit rather than taking energy out of it.

If you want more information, trying looking up ""electrodynamic propulsion"",
""tether applications"", and ""magsails"".


No.  A ""dragless"" satellite does not magically have no drag; it burns fuel
constantly to fight drag, maintaining the exact orbit it would have *if*
there was no drag.  This is why there are quotes around ""dragless"".",2

 observations, until the EUVE (launched last year) had almost

          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."" 
    
               (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."" 
    
               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-
          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL 
          DATUM""). 
      
               At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles 
          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star 
          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white 
          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY 
          BURSTS). 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of 
          matter. 

               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
          complex mathematics, in his books.

          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  
          They have other related publications, including the quarterly 
          journal ""RECIPROCITY"". 

          

          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer 
          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he 
          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used. 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same 
          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in 
          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. 
    
               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been 
          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! 
    
               ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"", 
          ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
    
    
               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
          still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring. 
    


          ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super 
          Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific"" 
          value. 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY 
          particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.) 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, 
          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are 
          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment. 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! 
    
               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 
          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money?! 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground 
          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the ""Supercollider""?! 
    
          
               Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as 
          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. 
      


          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made, in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, 
          which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"". 
     
               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, 
          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their 
          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each 
          other. 
      
               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half. 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, 
          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to 
          help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"". 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by 
          INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his 
          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special 
          Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near 
          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 
          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low 
          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. 
          [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing 
          about this.] 
    
     
               In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  
          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY). 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific 
          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 
          pages, indexed, hardcover. 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and 
          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-
          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white 
          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS! 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success: 
          In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also. 
    

 
          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS

               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were 
          originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the 
          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence). 
    
               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of 
          his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the 
          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls 
          the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the 
          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and 
          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at 
          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects, and come from all 
          directions uniformly.) 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to 
          stop it! 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B. Larson. 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is 
          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" 
          and in some of his other books. 
    
               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate 
          energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the 
          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements. 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some 
          of his books [better than I can]. 
    
               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. 
    
               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R 
          Diagram. 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space, making a single lone star 
          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system, orbiting each other. 
     
               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown 
          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron 
          stars"", ""black holes"", etc.. 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single 
          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf 
          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably 
          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! 
      
               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all 
          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law. 
          


          ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!

               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black 
          holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and 
          concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original ""black holes"". 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black 
          holes"", etc.! 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is 
          clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black 
          hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to ""prove"" their theory. 
    
    
               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is 
          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and 
          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT! 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of 
          Unified Science). 
          
          
          
          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe.  I quote one paragraph: 
    
               ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  
          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It 
          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in 
          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the 
          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open 
          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, 
          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system.  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  
          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."" 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).  
          (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, 
          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and 
          ""below"" labels mixed up.] 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-
          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light! 
    
               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge 
          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle.) 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds. 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has 
          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in 
          his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"". 
    
               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as 
          the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such 
          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, 
          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and 
          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. 
    
          

               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS). 



               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this 
          IMPORTANT partial summary is ENCOURAGED.

                                 GALILEO
                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                               POST-LAUNCH
                           April 23 - 29, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 22 and 23, delta Differenced One-way Range (DOR) passes were
performed over DSS-14/63 (Goldstone/Madrid 70 meter antennas) and DSS-14/43
(Goldstone/Canberra 70 meter antennas), respectively.  Initial results 
indicate the delta DOR pass on April 22 was unsuccessful due to ground
station hardware problems but the one on April 23 was successfully performed.

2.  On April 23, a cruise science Memory Readout (MRO) was performed for the
Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.  Analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

3.  On April 23, the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the
spacecraft stored sequence.  These relays were commanded closed by the CDS
(Command Data Subsystem) prior to launch and were again commanded closed to
preclude the possibility at Jupiter of the PPS relays/wiring being a
source of internal electrostatic charge (IESD).

4.  On April 26, cruise science Memory Readouts (MRO) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  During the period from April 26 to April 27, a navigation cycle was
performed.  This navigation cycle provided near-continuous acquisition of
two-way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the
spacecraft over DSS-63, DSS-14, and DSS-43.

6.  On April 26, real-time commands were sent to test slew the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) in preparation for the mini-sequence slew test on April 28.
The RRA was slewed from approximately 3.5 degrees from stow to approximately
20.3 degrees.  Preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18
degrees which was well within the predicted range.  The RRA was commanded back
to approximately 15.2 degrees from stow.  Preliminary analysis indicated the
antenna reached about 15.8 degrees also well within the predicted range.  The
RRA motor temperature was at 1 degree C at the start of the activity and had
increased to 1.6 degrees C at its completion.

     After verifying proper RRA slewing, the RRA slew test mini-sequence was
uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on April 28.  Upon successful uplink,
a Delayed Action Command (DAC) was sent which will reposition the stator on
May 4 to its initial pre-test position.  Also, a DAC was sent to turn the
Two-Way Noncoherent (TWNC) on April 28 prior to the start of the RRA slew test
mini-sequence.

7.  On April 27, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

8.  On April 28, the RRA slew test executed nominally.  The spacecraft under
stored sequence control performed six RRA slews starting at about 16 degrees
from stow and going to 53 degrees, back to 25 degrees, then to 51 degrees,
back to 22 degrees, then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees.  All of
the slews were well within the predicted range.  The RRA motor temperature was
at 2.3 degrees C at the start of the activity and had increased to 4.4
degrees C at its completion.  After completion of the RRA slews, real-time
commands were sent to reconfigure back to the pre-test configuration.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 17 DN
(3.9 volts).  The DC measurement reads 134 DN (15.7 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 29, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  75 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 23 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 4 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 203 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  The first Galileo-GDS test of the MGDS V18.0 Command System (CMD) took
place April 27, 1993 with DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna).  The test went
well and demonstrated that the new command system interfaced with the new DSN
(Deep Space Network) Group 5 Command Processor Assembly (CPA).  The test was
successful and the next test for V18.0 CMD is scheduled for May 1, 1993 with
DSS-15 (Goldstone 34 meter antenna).

2.  The April System Engineers Monthly Report(SEMR)/Ground System Development
Office (GSDO) MMR was conducted Thursday, April 29.   A review of current
Project and Institutional (DSN and MOSO) system status was conducted.  On-going
cruise development plus the GSDO Phase 1 and 2 delivery schedules, past months
accomplishments  and potential problem areas were discussed.  No significant
schedule changes or significant problems were reported.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 29, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         187,745,300 km (1.26 AU)
	Distance from Sun           296,335,800 km (1.98 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          89,100 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       522,015,800 km
	Round Trip Light Time       20 minutes, 58 seconds

Sorry, but yes he does, by your own description.


Humorous, this notion of an all-knowing, all-powerful god who must
""attempt"" to ""reconcile"" with his lowly creations.  I realize that it
is not possible to penetrate such logic, but is there any chance that
you might consider that an omnipotent god need not ""attempt"" anything,
and further that an attempt to ""reconcile"" implies a lack of
omniscience?

What you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god.



But all humans are sinners, thus all pre-Jesus humans should have been
punished with death.  We aren't punished with sin now, of course,
because God has changed.  He required a brutal, sadistic sacrifice of
his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.  


Yet he does so now.  He has changed.  The sadistic murder of his own
son has made him more tolerant of our sins.

Besides, his ""midst"" is everywhere, so your statement is meaningless.
He tolerates sin in Hell, which surely is in his midst as well.  Also,
given that he is all-knowing, he must have eternal knowledge of who
will commit which sins, as well as when and where, so what does
tolerance have to do with anything.  All of this is absolute nonsense,
unless your god is not indeed all-knowing and all-powerful, or unless
he doesn't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you
claim.


Not relevant.  The claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in
reference to your god.  The nature of his creations/victims is not at
issue.


I see: an all-knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome
would be, and an all-powerful god who had no choice in the matter.
Mindmush.


Did I miss something?  Did you give some indication at to why a KIND
and LOVING god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his
own botched creations to ""achieve salvation""?


 
I note that your answer physically follows my question, but I fail to
discern a connection between the two.

By the way, for what am I being consoled?



Why not?  By the way, I note for the record that you didn't answer the
questions. 


Death and/or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional
punishment?  I hope you aren't a parent.


This is quite an elaborate fantasy that you've constructed, but sadly
it lacks a basis in reality.  It also does not address the questions
that I raised.


The god that you describe is not a good parent, but a tyrant.


Sorry, was that the god of the Bible whose rules I am to follow, or
the god of the Koran?  The Vedas?  The Book of Koresh?  Oh, yes, it's
all so clear.

You would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are

that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of ""light""
can illuminate any ""object"" of atomic scale. If this image is to have
useful resolution, wouldn't the illuminating sources wavelength have
to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed?

If an atom is a ""probablity cloud"", lower resolutions would give the
appearance of solidity, but it seems fairly certain that an atom is
not an object is any conventional sense. Obviously I am not a
physicist, but the question does have ramification of a philosophic
nature. Anyway, just a stray thought, carry on ...",0

	Actually, for digital HDTV systems that's far higher bandwidth than
you need, unless there's some reason you must work in fully-uncompressed
HDTV.  Also, my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6MB,
even using 24 bits/pixel (which is more bits than you actually need - 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture).  1600x1100x16bits is 3.5MB (I'm
guessing at HDTV resolution - it may be a bit wider than 1600, I'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

	I hope you have a very fast memory system as well - 180MB/s while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved VRAM system.

	Unless you have a _very_ compelling reason, I'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data.  You don't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data IO requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with.

     Well, almost. It turns out that clever orbital mechanics can 
engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order 
harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field can pump energy into a 
satellite, and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of 
months to years. 

     My favorite example of this is the Soviet/Russian heavy ELINT 
satellites of the Cosmos 1603 class, which are in 14:1 resonance. In 
particular, C1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged *gain* in 
altitude, the current one having started in June 1991; the mean altitude 
of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 
March 1987. (Looking at the elements for C1833 also shows the 
limitations of NORAD's software -- but that's another story.) 

    This probably has little relevance to space stations, since the 71 
degree orbits of the C1603 satellites are at 850 km, which is 
unacceptably far into the inner van Allen belt for manned platforms. But 
it's kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the 
situation. 

    (Orbital elements for these satellites are available on request.)

Obviously not.  Count rates are too low and signal rise times too long
for this to be possible.  The CGRO, is, what, 10 meters long?  You'd
need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this.

What BATSE actually does is measure the relative strength in each of
the detectors (also as a function of photon energy).  Each of the
detectors does not have isotropic response.  To do this right one must
model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector,
and even scattering of photons off the Earth's atmosphere back onto
the spacecraft.  I believe they have now reduced the error to about 2

From _Free Inquiry_, Winter 83/84,  the following is an
introduction to the article ""Joseph Smith and the Book of
Mormon"", by George D. Smith.  The introduction is written by
Paul Kurtz. 

	Mormonism -- the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
	-- claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million.  It is one of
	the world's fastest growing religions, with as many as
	200,000 new converst in 1982 alone.  Because of the church's
	aggressive missionary program, covering more than one
	hundred countries, it is spreading even to third world
	countries.
	
	Mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and
	evangelical in preachment.  The church is run along strict
	authoritarian lines.  Led by a president, who allegedly
	receives revelations directly form God, and a group of
	twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief
	and practice, the church is opposed to abortion,
	pornography, sexual freedom, women's rights, and other, in
	its view, immoral influences of secular society, and it
	forbids the use of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, and tea.
	
	Centered in Salt Lake City, the church is extremely wealthy
	and politically powerful in Utal and many other western
	states.  Among well-know present-day Mormons are Ezra Taft
	Benson (former secretary of agriculture), the Osmond family,
	the Mariotts of the hotel empire, and a score of high-placed
	government officials.
	
	The Mormon church was founded in western New York in 1830 by
	Joseph Smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had
	found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill
	and that with the help of visits from the angel Moroni he
	had been able to translate the writing into the _Book of
	Mormon_, the basis of Mormon belief.  This book, written ""by
	the commandment of God,"" claims that the ancient Hebrews
	settled in America about 600 B.C.E. and were the ancestors
	of the American Indians.  Mormons believe that those who
	have been baptized in the ""true church"" will be reunited
	after death and that deceased non-Mormon family members can
	be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the
	hereafter.  Because of these beliefs, Mormons have been
	considered outcasts by mainline Christian denominations and
	as heretics by religious fundamentalists.
	
	Joseph Smith was a controversial figure in his day -- he was
	both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud.  Because
	of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from
	Palmyra, New York, westward to Ohio and then to Illinois,
	where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob.  Brigham
	Young, who reportedly had as many as eighty wives, took over
	the leadership of the church and led the Mormons further
	westward, to found the new Zion in Salt Lake City. 
	Following the teachings of Joseph Smith in the practice of
	polygamy was perhaps the Mormons most controversial practice
	in nineteenth-century America.
	
	While other religions go back many centuries --
	Muhammadanism, 1200 years; Christianity, 2000; and Judaism,
	3000 -- and attempts to examine their beginnings are
	difficult, extensive historical investigation of Mormon
	roots is possible.  Some Mormons are willing to examine this
	history objectively, bu others maintain that such scrutiny
	is dangerous to the faith.
	
	In the following pages, _Free Inquiry_ presents two articles
	about the Mormon church.  First, George D. Smith, a lifelong
	member of the church, provides a detailed critical
	examination of Joseph Smith and his claim the the _Book of
	Mormon_ was divinely revealed.  Second, we present a portion
	of an interview with philosopher Sterling McMurrin, also a
	Mormon since birth, who questions the treatment of the
	history of the church by Mormon authorities. -- Paul Kurtz

"In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words 
translated into the word ""hell"".  These Greek words have totally different 
meanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna.

    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the 
New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol...
meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be 
likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)

    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell
to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  

    Why?  Because when seeing the word ""hell"" many readers impute to it the 
traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never 
remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!

    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of 
the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of 
""shadowy realm.""  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to 
this hell.

    The second ""hell"" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in 
scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; ""For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast 
them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be 
reserved unto judgment...""

    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; 
Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels 
(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to 
Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the 
mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).

    Tartaros, then, is a ""hell"" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or
demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe 
the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible 
is there any mention of men being put into this particular ""hell"".

    The the third word that is translated as ""hell"" in the Bible is Gehenna. It
comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning ""valley of Hinniom.""  Hinnom is a 
deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.

    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including 
infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made 
their children ""pass through the fire"" to the god Molech.  The rites were 
specifically celebrated in Tophet, the ""place of abhorrence,"" one of the chief 
groves in the valley).

    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He 
defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later 
the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for 
sewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were 
also burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding 
by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.

    Aceldama, the ""field of blood"", purchased with the money Judas received for
the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.

    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  

    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working 
religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the 
re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.
Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: ""And the beast was taken, and with 
him the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire 
burning with brimstone.""
    
    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this ""hell"") be?

    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: ""For 
Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is 
prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, 
the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it"" (Isa.30:33).

    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled 
fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).

    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible 
say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of 
fire?

    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be 
thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will 
become of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? 
 
    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna 
fire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This 
punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the 
""second death"" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a 
further resurrection.

    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing.
                           
    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. ""For, behold, the day 
cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do 
wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up...""
(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be ""ashes under the 
soles of your feet...""(Mal.4:3).

    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living 
torture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or 
valley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, 
but ashes!
 
    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means 
complete destruction, not living torture (not eternal life in torment)!  The 
Bible says, in Romans 6:23, ""The wages of sin is death"", not eternal life in 
torture.  The punishment revealed in the Bible is Death... the cessation of 
life. ",3

"Russell Turpin, as is his wont, has raised some interesting issues 
in his struggle with the Christian texts and the Christians. 
Unfortunately, he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is 
not available. The lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable 
result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such 
as humanity. 

Also unfortunately (perhaps) I have a deadline in two weeks, the 
responsibility for which prevents me, in good conscience, 
from writing a more considered response and fully entering the
fray, as it were. 

Let me then say what I can, briefly.

-----


This point, for the net.browsers who also still read books, is
pursued throughly in Kaufmann, Critique_of_Religion_and_Philosophy.


This is a theological statement worthy of Barth.
Dr Turpin (DD) may wear the black robe of Geneva yet! :-)


This requires the assumption that all interpretations are
equally valid, that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing
among them. I wouldn't make that assumption; I don't think it is
a reasonable assumption. 


Michael, and I, and others, read 'the Bible' with Christian
glasses. Among the things that this should imply is that the
NT informs the OT, even to the point of dominanting it. Some
points in the OT (ceremonial & dietary laws) are explicitly 
abrogated by the NT texts. To drive Russell Turpin's point with
adequacy, one needs to begin with NT texts (probably from Matthew,
and probably about damnation) (Just trying to help :-) )

This part is, I discover, what most moves me to post:

mls> I am a ""radical"" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.


Russell Turpin's 'No' here is misplaced, not to say inappropriate.
Michael's self-description much govern.  The equation of radical = liberal, 
which seems implied by Russell Turpin  is wrong.  Radical conservatives are 
possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). Thomas Merton
was a radical, even though conservative in some ways. St Francis
was a radical, similarly. How many examples are needed?

mls> ... Why don't I and the (myriads of) other Christians like me
mls> tell you something about Christianity? ...

Michael's question gets to a heart of the matter (Klingons have
two hearts, so my metaphor is not mixed, just extraterrestrial :-) )
Russell Turpin (in an earlier post) had said that Michael (Michael's
theological positions, actually) didn't tell him much about Christianity;
Dean Simeon responds (this time gently): 'What do you mean?' More
direct, perhaps, would have been: 'What could you possibly mean?'
The implied rhetorical effort, to separate Michael from the 
tradition, is a failure. Michael is in the tradition. If your idea
of the tradition doesn't include him, Change your idea of the tradition!


How can one answer this while staying on the more general issue?
I'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from Michael)
on this issue, yet '*nothing*' is a hideous overstatement.

One verse is enough to refute it; I'll offer two, from
Paul (of all people):

'In Jesus Christ there is neither male nor female...'(Galatians 3:28
{I don't quote single verses as a rule, and I don't carry 
them in my head}) and '*Nothing* shall separate us from the glory of God...' 
(roughly, from Romans). [If Russell would promise to convert based
on these or any other verses,  I'd promise to get the full context
for any that he requires :-) :-)]


This conclusion does not follow, even in short, from the
argument that goes before. A surprising logical ellipsis.

:  people involved with the field. IMHO the wider meaning is not

:  perceives you as a thief, then this person belongs to a very very
:  small group that has some computer knowledge, but not enough to know
:  the wider (and original) meaning of the word.  [....]

Unfortunately, the general public has a very narrow view of the deep, dark
recesses of the art of computing.  What little they do see is from the view
given to them by the media.  From what I have seen from the media, 'hacker'
is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.

I, on the other hand, know what 'hacker' means from those who consider
themselves such.  Following is the definition from ""Jargon File 2.9.10"".
(This is also known as the ""Hackers Dictionary"".)  The definitions are
arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage:

   :hacker: [originally, someone who makes furniture with an axe] n.
     1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
     systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most
     users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary.  2. One who
     programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
     programming rather than just theorizing about programming.  3. A
     person capable of appreciating {hack value}.  4. A person who is
     good at programming quickly.  5. An expert at a particular program,
     or one who frequently does work using it or on it; as in 'a UNIX
     hacker'.  (Definitions 1 through 5 are correlated, and people who
     fit them congregate.)  6. An expert or enthusiast of any kind.  One
     might be an astronomy hacker, for example.  7. One who enjoys the
     intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
     limitations.  8. [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to
     discover sensitive information by poking around.  Hence 'password
     hacker', 'network hacker'.  See {cracker}.

     The term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
     community defined by the net (see {network, the} and
     {Internet address}).  It also implies that the person described
     is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see
     {hacker ethic, the}).

     It is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
     oneself that way.  Hackers consider themselves something of an
     elite (a meritocracy based on ability), though one to which new
     members are gladly welcome.  There is thus a certain ego
     satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
     you claim to be one and are not, you'll quickly be labeled
     {bogus}).  See also {wannabee}.

   :hacker ethic, the: n.  1. The belief that information-sharing
     is a powerful positive good, and that it is an ethical duty of
     hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
     facilitating access to information and to computing resources
     wherever possible.  2. The belief that system-cracking for fun
     and exploration is ethically OK as long as the cracker commits
     no theft, vandalism, or breach of confidentiality.

     Both of these normative ethical principles are widely, but by no
     means universally) accepted among hackers. Most hackers subscribe
     to the hacker ethic in sense 1, and many act on it by writing and
     giving away free software.  A few go further and assert that
     *all* information should be free and *any* proprietary
     control of it is bad; this is the philosophy behind the {GNU}
     project.

     Sense 2 is more controversial: some people consider the act of
     cracking itself to be unethical, like breaking and entering.
     But this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
     see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also {samurai}).  On
     this view, it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
     to (a) break into a system, and then (b) explain to the sysop,
     preferably by email from a {superuser} account, exactly how it
     was done and how the hole can be plugged --- acting as an
     unpaid (an unsolicited) {tiger team}.

     The most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
     ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
     technical tricks, software, and (where possible) computing
     resources with other hackers.  Huge cooperative networks such as
     {USENET}, {Fidonet} and Internet (see {Internet address})
     can function without central control because of this trait; they
     both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
     hackerdom's most valuable intangible asset.

:  Finally, a true hacker does not name himself/herself one, for this is
:  a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.
: To me, a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
: says ""Nahh, I just know a thing or two, people always exagerate..."" :-)

Note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing
limself (meaning: himself/herself) one, but simply says that it is better
not to do so.  There are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'.  So,
in order to defend the true meaning of the word, it is sometimes necessary
to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the
workplace.  (This means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well-known
and respected person.)  Sometimes, there may only be one such person.

: >No matter what Mr. Dumpty says, language doesn't work that way.
:  Actually it does, you just have to get adequate press coverage... :-)

Language works anyway that we want it to work.  The purpose of language is
to communicate.  To oversimplify: As long as communication is taking place,
then language is working.

IMO, the influence of Stalin, or for that matter, Ayn Rand, invalidates your 
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.  Gullibility, 
blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more 
reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of
fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators
of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.  Now, *some*
brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,
I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned
argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?


Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would
be irrational.  Which is it?

The first part of the second statement contains no information, because
you don't say what ""the beliefs"" are.  If ""the beliefs"" are strong theism 
and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The
second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it.


I can't agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
I suspect you do not have.


I don't understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?",0

If you're doing large-scale satellite servicing, being able to do it in

You'd almost certainly use air.  Given that you have to pressurize with

I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter
emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they
would have HAD to land with HST in the bay. 

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that
they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one
that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  
I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was
as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper
envelope of what the Shuttle can do.

I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,
cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in
addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment 
mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second 
time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a 
few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two 
servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down 
and take it up again.",2

The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands
for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually
named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most

of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some

I would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which
ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus.  In the real world
(tm) it's easier for theists (well, people in general really) to lock
themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those
people who are of the same opinion as they are.  In college you are
constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have
different ideas about life, the universe, and everything.  It is much much
harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else's ideas from
reaching you.

So, in a world where theists are forced to contend with and listen to
atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in
their beliefs over four years.  There is nowhere to run.... :-)

"Introducing the Back to the Moon in Congress:
                          The Next Step
                          
        The next key hurdle for the Lunar Resources Data Purchase 
Act is introduction of the Act in Congress. At this point,  many
congresspersons have been approached about the bill. However,
for a successful effort to pass the bill, we need the best
possible congressperson to introduce the bill. Due to his
position as Chair of the House Committee on Space and Science,
Congressman George Brown is the logical choice. He has a long
record of support and interest in space development, and helped
pass the Launch Services Purchase Act and the Space Settlements
Act.                      
        There is a small group of activists in southern California 
who have assisted George Brown in his recent re-election campaigns.
We are mobilizing this group to have them tell Congressman Brown
about the Back to the Moon bill. We are also asking pro-space
constituents to let him know that they care about getting
America back to the Moon.
        Finally, there is a good chance that a nationwide alert 
for space activists to call or write George Brown to have him
introduce the Back to the Moon bill may be staged during late
spring, 1993.
        All this should produce a positive reaction from Brown's
office. As more is known, it will be passed on.
        However, even if we are successful in getting him to support
the bill,  this alone will not ensure passage of the bill. For
any bill to become law, one of three conditions must exist:
either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an
issue (such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits); be
propelled by high-priced lobbyists (we're out of luck there); or
have widespread support within Congress, due to small, but
widespread, constituent support. The latter is the path that we,
by necessity, must choose.                    
        This means that the introduction of the Lunar Resources 
Data Purchase Act must be immediately accompanied by a large number
of congresspersons' sponsorship of the bill.  To accomplish
this, we need activists to ask their congressperson to support
the Lunar Resources Data Purchase Act - now. To wait until the
bill is introduced is simply too late - it takes time to have a
congressperson's staff review a bill.
        If your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet
introduced, please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently
written. We appreciate all comments on the bill from activists
and politicians.
        If you have yet to see the Back to the Moon bill, please
request a copy by Email (please include your U.S. postal service
address), or contact your local chapter of the National Space
Society).",2

"Stuff deleted

I reiterate that I would agree with you that there is little
justification for the punishment of apostasy in the Qur'an.
In Islamic history, as well, apostasy has rarely been punished. 
Belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there
is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief, apostates have
been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.

However, when an apostate makes attacks upon ""God and
His Messenger"" the situation changes. Now the charge of
apostasy may be complicated with other charges - perhaps 
charges of sedition, treason, spying, etc. If the person 
makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public
attacks (as opposed to arguement) against Islam, the
situation is likewise complicated. If the person spreads
slander or broadcasts falsehoods, again the situation
changes. The punishments vary according to the situation
the apostate is in. Anyhow, the charge of aggravated
apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in Rushdie's case.

There is a distinction in the Qur'an between a formal war situation
and being in the situation where someone unilaterally
wages war (by their actions), creates disorder, makes mischief,etc. 
against the Muslims and creates a situation that results in harm 
to Muslims. Here, a small group or even a single individual could
be said to be engaged in such a practise. In other words, there is
a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two
clearly defined parties wage war, conclude treaties, exchange
prisoners, etc.), and dealing with attacks that come from isolated
individuals or groups against Islam. It is the second situation, 
the unilateral attack and the spreading of ""fasad"" that 
would apply in the case of Rushdie.

The matter of Rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an 
offensive book (banning the book is secondary) -
a full set of circumstances following the publication of
the book come into play as well, including the deaths of many
Muslims, and Rushdie's (and his publishers) Media games.




I am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. I believe
that one of the Qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5:33.
Every verse in the Qur'an has a corresponding ""circumstance of
revelation"" but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the
verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance
in which it was revealed. If this was the case then we could say
that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the
Muslims were NOT involved in conflict, should be suspended when
they were at war. The logic does not follow. In complex, real-life
situations, there may be many verses and many hadiths which can
all be related to a single, complicated situation. The internal
relationships between these verses may be quite complex, such that
arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how
each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.
It is not necessarily a simple ""this or that"" process. There may
be many parameters involved, there may be a larger context in
which a particular situation should be viewed. All these matters
impinge on the situation.

In other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the Qur'an.
The Qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses, but this reflection must
entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.
If the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety, then each
person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.
However, if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to
the
State, to the gestation of laws and rulings, to the gestation of society,
the dispensing of justice, the guidance of the community, then there 
are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one 
should achieve. Jaffar Ibn Muhammad as-Sadiq(a.s.) relates some of 
these requirements, as taught by the Prophet(S.A.), in a hadith:

""...he who does not distinguish in the Book of Allah the abrogating
verse from the abrogated one, and a specific one from a general one,
and a decisive from an ambiguous; and does not differentiate between
a permission and an obligation, and does not recognize a verse of
Meccan period from a Medinite one, and does not know the circumstances 
of revelation, and does not understand the technical words of
the Qur'an (whether simple or compound); and does not comprehend the
knowledge of decree and measure, and is ignorant of advancing and
delaying (in its verses); and does not distinguish the clear from
the deep, nor the manifest from the esoteric, nor the beginning
from the termination; and is unaware of the question and the answer,
the disjoining and the joining, and the exceptions and the all-inclusive,
and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the
subsequent one; and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the
detailed one, the obligatory laws and the permissions, the places of the
duties and rules, and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful; and
does not know the joined words, and the words that are related to those
coming before them, or after them - then such a man does not know
the Qur'an; nor is he among the people of the Qur'an...."".

Based on these and other hadiths, and in accordance with many Qur'anic
verses (""Why should not a company from every group remain behind 
to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn 
people when they return to them, so that they may beware."" (9:122)),
a science of jurisprudence arose. The requirements
for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on
matters of law and religion) are many. I've listed a few major 
divisions below - there are, of course, many subdivisions within these
headings.

- Knowledge of Arabic (syntax, conjugation, roots, semantics, oratory).
- Knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.
- Logic (mantiq)
- A knowledge of Hadiths
- A knowledge of transmitters (rijal)
- Knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (Qur'an, Sunnah, Consensus,
Reasoning)

The study of Qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves:
- discussion of imperatives (awamir)
- discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)
- discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)
- discussion of unconditional and conditional
- discussion of tacit meanings
- discussion of the abstract and the clear
- discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated

The principles of Application of the law involves:
- principles of exemption
- principles of precaution
- principles of option
- principles of mastery

The jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. It is not a matter
of looking at one verse and one hadith. 

Now no one should blindly follow anyone, but there is a difference
between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. There is the
""The fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the Prophet, as 
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires, pleasures,
and wealth of this world."" The Prophet (S.A.) was asked: ""O Messenger
of God! How may we know if they so concern themselves?"" He (S.A.) replied:
""By seeing whether they follow the ruling power. If they do that, fear for
your religion and shun them."" I do not yet know enough about the Imams
of the four Sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.

The Prophet also refered to the fuqaha as ""The fortress of Islam"". My only
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into
play a certain amount of expertise - the specifics of this expertise is 
delineated in the Qur'an and hadith. Those who acquire this expertise
are praised in both the Qur'an and hadith - those who without the requisite
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society, state, and religion 
are cautioned.

The only reason I said anything at all about the Rushdie affair in this
group, is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is,
apostasy), was wrong. When one discusses something they should at least
base their discussion on fact. Secondly, Khomeini was condemned as a
heretic
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible - another instance of
creating a straw man and then beating him.


I agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.

I do not have any access to email, so private discussion or a moderated
group
is out of the question (I cannot post to a moderated group like

  Thanks for the etymology lesson, but I actually know what ""orthodox"" means.
You're avoiding my question, however, which was: From what body of theology
does your version of orthodoxy come?  You seem to simply be saying that
whatever *you* understand the Bible to say is ""orthodox.""


  You are obviously mistaken, since many, many people have read the Bible and
many do not agree with you on this point.  Once again, Robert, is your
interpretation the only ""correct"" or ""orthodox"" one?



   This whole string began as a response to your attacks on Mormonism; no one
is attacking your personal beliefs, only your tendency to present them as
""orthodoxy.""  I don't much care *what* you believe about the Bible; just don't
present you personal understanding as the only ""orthodox"" one.


   I have never attacked your specific beliefs -- that's *your* approach,

    Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views
is indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways, which has been
my whole point all along.  The specifics of your belief are your business;
just don't pretend that they are anything more than your personal
intepretation, and be careful about crying ""heresy"" based on your private

#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators
#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.
# 
#That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the
#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.

If you believe that, you're incredibly naive.

#>Now, *some*
#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,
#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned
#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction
#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?
#>
#That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to
#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to
#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,
#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.

No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common
with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn't implied by
what you say before, because you're trying to sneak in ""innate features
of [all] theism"".  The word you're groping for is ""some"".

#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.

No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed
to the case you are trying to make?

#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.

I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That's because it's an irrational
and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us 
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls.

#>|>(2)  Define ""irrational belief"".  e.g., is it rational to believe that
#>|>     reason is always useful?
#>|>
#>|
#>|Irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. The latter has
#>|been discussed for a long time with Charley Wingate. One point is that
#>|the beliefs violate reason often, and another that a process that does
#>|not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.
#>
#>Well, there is a glaring paradox here:  an argument that reason is useful
#>based on reason would be circular, and argument not based on reason would
#>be irrational.  Which is it?
#>
#That's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of
#usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.

O.K., it's oval.  It's still begging the question, however.  And though
that certainly is allowed, it's not rational.  And you claiming to be
rational and all.

At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing ""we had that before"" [we
didn't hear a _refutation_ before, so we're back.   Deal with it] :
you can't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone
who thinks reason is crap won't buy it, you see.

#Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
#and mathematics are therfore circular.

Anybody else think Godel was silly?

#>The first part of the second statement contains no information, because
#>you don't say what ""the beliefs"" are.  If ""the beliefs"" are strong theism
#>and/or strong atheism, then your statement is not in general true.  The
#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an
#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is
#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
#>used to obtain it.
#>
# 
#I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
#of god here.
# 
#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here
#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the
#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
#out of which they are usually derived. ""I exist"" is derived, if you want
#it that way.
#
#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.
# 
#what is it you are trying to say?

That at some point, people always wind up saying ""this datum is reliable"" 
for no particular reason at all.  Example: ""I am not dreaming"".

#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.
#>
#>I can't agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To
#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
#>I suspect you do not have.
#>
# 
#Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities
#with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or
#the way the world works.

IMO, any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational.  That does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence.  Some atheists are also scientists, for example.

#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe
#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. However, the beliefs say they are
#>|more than a work hypothesis.
#>
#>I don't understand this.  Can you formalise your argument?
# 
#Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make
#B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that
#it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating
#evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)
#says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further
#contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can
#have interesting effects.

Peculiar definition of interesting, but sure.  Now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren't my 
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they 
don't believe in it.  Maybe it's the conjunction of ""B asserts B"" and
""jail/kill dissenters"" that is important, and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no
axe to grind here.

"Hi,


I just sent a mail to Turgut Kalfaoglu (sp?), the maintainer of the list,
and asked him what's going on. If the list is (for whatever reason) really
dead, we might have to put up a list ourselves. But for now, I want to wait

Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it
payload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the
same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.


They where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. A resurected
Saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored)
which is five times cheaper than Shuttle.

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!",1
"""The Forever War"", one of my favorite SciFi books, had a passage devoted to 
breathing fluids. The idea was to protect people from the high accelerations 
required for interstellar travel by emersing the passengers in dry-cleaning 
fluid saturated with oxygen. Plenty of very imaginative ideas is this book.
I would certainly recommend it (won the Hugo and the Nebula awards).",2

We can only say that they are beyond about 25 AU, due to the low
accuracy of position determination by single detectors.


It may be a NEW Physics problem (i.e. a problem involving new
physics).  However, the data is not good enough to rule out the >100
models which use old physics.  New physics is a big step, and is only
tolerated when there is no alternative.  For example , the Dark Matter
Problem (there's more to the universe than meets the eye) is a question
of comparable mystery to GRBs, but we have much better data regarding
it.  Theoreticians postulate new particles all the time to explain it,
but no one will actually believe that these particles are real until an
experimentalist (or several) detects them in the lab.

"Astronomy & Space magazine's UK telephone newsline carries the times to
see the Russian Space Station Mir which will be visible every EVENING (some
time between 9 o'clock and midnight) from April 27 to May 7. It's about as
bright as Jupiter at its best. There are two cosmonuats on board.

For the time to watch, tel. 0891-88-19-50 (48p/min peak 36p/min all other
times, but prediction is at start of the weekly message so it only costs a
few pence).

E-mail reports of sightings would be appreciated: give lat/long and UT (a
few seconds accuracy if possible) when it passes ABOVE or BELOW any bright
star (say brighter than mag. 3), planet or Moon.

With Moon in evening sky also, note that from somewhere in U.K. Mir will
pass in front of the Moon each night! Please alert local clubs to the
telephone newsline, and general public as Mir can cause quite a stir!

Dear Colleague,                                        April 25, 1993

Number 1 of volume 17 of Informatica is now out of print and some of you 
will receive it in a week or so. As you will see, the journal is structured
in the following way: the editorial (first page); profiles (second page
-- biography of an editor, in this issue, Terry Winograd); the edited
part of papers (pp. 3-80); mission and research reports (A plan for
knowledge archives project in Japan and CSLI in Stanford, pp. 81-100);
and news and announcements (pp. 101-108). This structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant, diverse, and interesting, bringing your own views
into the discourse.
   A great emphasis is given to the so-called editorial page. This page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics, extending into other
concerning disciplines, e.g. cybernetics, advanced AI, cognitive sciences,
mind, informationally concerned neural sciences, advanced technology 
(e.g. photonics), etc. I asked professor Terry Winograd to write this
page for Number 2. I certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors, who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
   On the second page of each Number an editor's profile is published.
The aim of the profile is twofold: to show his/her professional 
achievements, interests, scientific, and philosophical orientation on
one side; to narrate his/her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. This kind of story should
be instructive, adequately factically faced, contributing to the 
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
   The edited part (edited papers) is still critical. I would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance, so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. January, April, July, and October). In situation
right now, I ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues, collaborators, students, etc. Some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
A special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
   Reports of different occasions (symposia, conferences, meetings, etc.)
and particularly on new books, papers, and interesting events are welcome.
You can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e-mail.
On the other hand, you can send books and other publications (annual
reports, journals, calls for papers, etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in Informatica. We in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
   E-mail is functioning satisfactorily, so please use it in every respect.
You can submit editorial notes, profiles, reports, news and even complete
papers written in standard LaTex format (especially formulas). We received
several final (corrected) texts in Number 1 from different sites (US,
Russia, etc.). In this way, you can compose reports from already typed
texts, using your own choice and editing, and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si), who is always being on your disposal. So,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

At the end, please do not forget: we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. The aim of Informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and 
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up, still unrevealed,
and on the way to become significant. Please, do not apprehend to give
proposals, suggestions, and, certainly, contributions via the e-mail
and by other means.

Sincerely yours,",1

There are people who have adapted to high altitudes in the Andes and in
Tibet. I suspect that it took them several generations to make the
adaptation because Europeans had difficulty making the adaptation. They
had to send the women to a lower altitude when they were pregnant in order
to insure sucessful childbirth.


Another factor you should consider is the X-ray opacity of the atmosphere 
in case of stellar flares, the uv opacity is also important because uv 
radiation can kill or damage microbes, plants, and animals. ",2
